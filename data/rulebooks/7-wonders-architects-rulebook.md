## SETUP

**For each player**

1. Choose a **tray** (or take one randomly), then remove the 5 pieces of your Wonder and the holder containing your cards.

2. Each **Wonder** is made of 5 Stages of construction with an Under Construction side and a Constructed side. Assemble your Wonder with the Under Construction faceup, referring to the diagram on your tray.

3. Shuffle your cards and put them faceup in your holder to make a **deck** between the player to your left and yourself.

**For all players, in the middle of the table**

4. Shuffle the common cards and make a **central deck**, facedown.

5. Leave a space for the **discard** next to the central deck: you’ll place all used cards here, faceup.

6. Shuffle the **Progress tokens** and make a stack, facedown. Take the top 3 tokens and put them faceup next to the stack.

7. Consult the table below and place the corresponding number of **Conflict tokens**, Peace side up. Remove the remaining Conflict tokens from the game.

   | Number of players | 2 - 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 - 7 |
   |------------------:|:----:|:-:|:-:|:----:|
   | Number of Conflict tokens | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

8. Make a reserve of **Military Victory tokens**.

9. Finally, place the **Cat pawn**.

## TURN OVERVIEW

Going clockwise and starting with the youngest player, the game plays over several turns.

On your turn, choose a card from the **3 available**:

* The top card of the deck directly to your **left**,
* The top card of the deck directly to your **right**,
* The top card of the **central deck**.

Place your chosen card **in front of you**, near your Wonder.

Depending on the cards and tokens you have, take the different actions explained below, **in any order**.

When you cannot take any more actions, your turn is over and the player to your left can begin their turn.

***Notes:***

* *If a deck is empty, it remains empty until the end of the game.*
* *Stack your cards of the same color so that their banners are visible.*

### GREY CARDS

Grey cards provide **Resources** that will let you construct the Stages of your Wonder.

If you have the Resources needed to construct a Stage of your Wonder, you **must** construct it during your turn.

### YELLOW CARDS

Yellow cards provide **Coins** that act as a wild Resource.

These Coins must replace **any missing Resource** needed to construct a Stage of your Wonder.

#### Constructing a Stage

The construction cost of each Stage is shown on each piece

* **2≠** - 2 **different** Resources.
* **2=** - 2 **identical** Resources.
* **3≠** - 3 **different** Resources.
* **3=** - 3 **identical** Resources.
* **4≠** - 4 **different** Resources.

Each Wonder is constructed Stage by Stage and **always from bottom to top**.

A Stage is available to construct only when **all Stages below it are constructed**.

Certain Wonders will give you an option for the order of construction.

When you have the Resources needed (Grey and/or Yellow cards) to construct an available Stage, **discard them**, and then flip the Stage over to its **Constructed** side.

Once constructed, certain Stages will let you immediately benefit from special effects.

***Note:** If you have the Resources to construct multiple Stages in one turn, you must do so.*

### BLUE CARDS

Blue cards provide **Victory points**. Additionally, a Cat icon is shown on certain Blue cards.

As soon as you take a Blue card with a Cat icon, take the Cat pawn from wherever it is on the table and place it in front of you.

#### Using the Cat pawn

As long as you have the Cat pawn, at the beginning of your turn, you can **secretly look at the top card of the central deck** before choosing your card.

### GREEN CARDS

Green cards provide **Science symbols** that let you gain Progress tokens.

If you have **2 identical** or **3 different Science symbols**, you **must** take a Progress token during your turn.

#### Taking a Progress token

**Discard** any Green cards used, then choose a Progress token from the **4 available**:

* Any one of the three faceup tokens,
* Or the top token of the facedown stack.

Once a faceup Progress token is taken, immediately replace it with the top token of the stack, placing it faceup.

Put the chosen Progress token faceup in front of you. You immediately benefit from its effect, now until the end of the game.

#### Using Progress tokens

During your turn, you can use your Progress tokens **in any order and whenever you want**.

Each of your Progress tokens can only be used **once per turn**, except for those that provide Victory points, which will only be used at the end of the game.

### RED CARDS

Red cards provide **Shields** that increase your military strength. Additionally, 1 or 2 Horn icons are shown on certain Red cards.

When you take a Red card with 1 or 2 Horn icons, flip over 1 or 2 Conflict tokens respectively to their **Battle side**.

When you flip the last Conflict token to its Battle side, you trigger a Battle, **at the end of your turn**, for **all players**.

***Note:** If you must flip over multiple Conflict tokens, but there is only one left on its Peace side, only flip over this one token and ignore any extra  Horn  icons.*

#### Resolving a Battle

Each player counts the **number of Shields** on their Red cards and compares it with their 2 neighbors (the players seated to their left and right).

***Note:** The Rhodes Wonder and the Tactics Progress token can provide additional Shields.*

**For each neighbor**, if you have more Shields than them, take **1 Military Victory token**. You can therefore gain either 0, 1, or 2 Military Victory tokens per Battle.

Then, **all** players discard their Red cards with 1 or 2 Horn icons. Only Red cards without a Horn icon should remain in front of you. Finally, flip over all of the Conflict tokens to their **Peace side**.

## END OF THE GAME

Once one player has finished constructing their Wonder, the game is over **at the end of that player’s turn**.

Calculate your score by adding up any **Victory points** shown on your:

* Constructed Stages of your Wonder,
* Cat pawn, if you have it,
* Blue cards,
* Military Victory tokens,
* Progress tokens.

**The player with the highest score wins the game.**

In case of a tie, the player who constructed the most Stages wins. If there’s still a tie, both players share the victory.

## 2 PLAYER GAME

For 2-player games, the only change happens during the **Resolving a Battle** phase.

If you have more Shields than your opponent, take **1 Military Victory token**.

However, if you have **at least twice as many** Shields than your opponent, take **2 Military Victory tokens** instead of just one.
