## Table of Contents

## Learn to Play Guide

**Welcome to Gloomhaven!** This game is **fully cooperative**, with players working together to navigate their way through a campaign of scenarios. You will not play it all in one sitting, but it can easily be saved at the end of any single scenario. This book is meant to walk you step‑by‑step through the first five scenarios of this campaign, after which point you should have all the tools to continue on through the rest of it. It is encouraged that you play as you read this book. Any time you see this icon TODO off to the side, the text will direct you to do something in the game.

Let’s start by getting out the Scenario Book. Its front cover contains the introduction to the story of this campaign and will direct you to unlock Scenario 1. Each scenario is meant to be played until successfully completed, and then players will move on to a new scenario. Playing through Scenario 1 will unlock Scenario 2 and so on. Now, go ahead and read the front cover of the Scenario Book and refer back to ‘Scenario 1 Rules’ here on p. 3 when the Scenario Book directs you to do so.

## Scenario 1 Rules

To start, perhaps you noticed this in the Scenario Book:

This means to take that first sticker from the sticker sheet,
labeled “Roadside Ambush”, and place it in the “B1” square
of the city map board, such that the artwork lines up.

The city map board is a way to see which scenarios are
available for you to play. At the moment, only Scenario 1
is available, but as you progress through the campaign,
more choices will open up. Set the city map board to the
side for now, though.

Before we get into Scenario 1, each player must decide
which character they are going to play. There are four
characters available, allowing up to four players to
participate in the game.

Playing by Yourself?

*If you are playing the game by yourself, you will need to control two separate characters. Take note that this is a more complex experience. If there are two to four players, it is highly recommended that each player only controls a single character.*

To choose which character to play, *find the large and small boxes with the four character icons and remove the contents*:

**Demolitionist:**
Melee Damage and Obstacle Destruction

**Hatchet:**
Ranged Damage and Looting

**Red Guard:**
Protection and Monster Manipulation

**Voidwarden:**
Healing and Support

There are figures of the characters in the small boxes, and the large boxes contain character mats with artwork on the front and a description of the character on the back. Once characters are chosen, players should claim their character’s **figure** and **mat**, the rectangular **initiative order token** from their character’s zip bag, a **hit point dial** from the game box, a **deck of smaller cards with no warning**, and the **first seven cards from the larger deck with no warning**. These card decks are located in the character’s large box. Of the seven cards taken from that deck, one is a **player reference card** and six are **ability cards** with an “A” in the crown under the title. The two decks with warnings, along with the remainder of the other large deck, the character sheet pad, and the strip of circular character tokens, should remain in the box for now.

## Play Area Setup !

Using these character materials and other components,
we will now set up Scenario 1.
Each player should place their character mat  , player
reference  , six level “A” ability cards  , attack
modifier deck (the deck of smaller cards)  , and hit
point dial  in front of them. The red side of the dial
should be set to the red number below the white “1” on
the bottom their character mat. The blue side of this dial
should be ignored for now.
The character’s initiative order token  should be
placed near the center of the table.
Open the Scenario Book to Scenario 1  and place it
in the middle of the table. This book shows the scenario
map, which consists of a number of hexes (hexagons)
where the scenario will play out.
Each player can now place their character’s figure on any
one of the starting hex icons  in the Scenario Book,
with no two characters occupying the same hex.
Retrieve the zip bag of “Vermling Raider” monsters
and remove the cardboard standees, the large square
stat card, and the initiative order token, which can be
placed with the others  . The smaller cards are not
needed in this scenario. Insert the stat card in one of the
six‑section envelopes from the box so that the area with
the “1” in the upper left corner is showing   and place
it next to the Scenario Book.
Now put the monster standees into the white and gold
plastic stands found in the game box and populate the
map in the Scenario Book  following these rules:
1) This icon shows what set and rank of monster
should be set up on this specific hex. Reference the
first row for two player characters, the middle row
for three characters, and the bottom row for
four characters.
2) A black icon means no monster should be placed for
that character count, white means a normal monster
(standee with a white stand) should be placed, and gold
means an elite monster (standee with a gold stand)
should be placed. Each standee has a number on it. This
number should be randomized when setting them up.
Take the plastic token tray   and put it next to the
Scenario Book. Also take the other 20-card deck of attack
modifier cards labeled “M”   from the game box and
place it next to the monster stat card (do not include
any Curse or Bless cards 13 ). This is the monsters’
attack modifier deck. Shuffle this and all character
attack modifier decks.

## Scenario Book Features

There is a lot of important information in the
Scenario Book that should be noted:
Scenario number, title, and city map
board location, for ease of reference.
Goal of scenario. When this is achieved,
the scenario is successfully completed. In
this case, all monsters on the map must
be killed.
Scenario key, listing what monsters from
the game box and what tokens and tiles
from the token tray will be needed to set
up the map. In this case, all that is needed
are the Vermling Raiders.
Map Layout. For this scenario, this
just shows that the two-page spread in
the scenario book is sufficient to depict
the scenario. Future scenarios may also
show that a separate page from the
Supplemental Scenario Book is needed.
Introduction text. Read this now.
Special rules text. Read this after
the introduction. It gives additional
information not covered by the normal
rule set.
Conclusion text. Do not read this until
the scenario has been successfully
completed.
Rewards for successfully completing the
scenario. Read this after the conclusion.
Tips and rules reminders. Read these as
needed during the scenario.
Obstacle designations on the scenario
map, signified by a green border. Obstacle
hexes cannot be entered.
Wall designations on the map. The
hexes of each scenario are contained
within a thick, dark border line. These
lines are the walls of the scenario and
cannot be crossed.

## Playing the Game

Now that the game has been set up properly, we can
start playing! Gameplay within a scenario is broken up
into a series of rounds. In each round, all players will
select which ability cards they would like to play. The
chosen cards will determine the “initiative order”, which
is the sequence in which characters and monsters will
perform their turns. Once all figures (characters and
monsters) on the map have taken a turn, the round will
end and a new round will begin.

Every round follows the same order:

1. Card Selection
2. Ordering of Initiative
3. Character and Monster Turns
4. End of Round

Let’s begin with the first part of the first round.

### Card Selection Card Selection

Each player will now privately and simultaneously select
two ability cards from their hand of six cards to play face
down in front of them. During this step, players can make
general statements about their actions for the round
and discuss strategy, but they cannot show other players
their cards nor give specific information about any
numerical value or card title.
Of the two cards chosen, one is selected as the initiative
card, which will determine the character’s initiative
(order in the round), based on the initiative value in the
center of the card  , where lower numbers go first.
The initiative card should be placed face down beneath
the other card such that, when both cards are flipped
over and revealed, it is now the card on top and the
initiative value is visible.

Once the character’s turn comes up in the initiative
order, they will carry out their turn by performing the
top action  of one of their cards and the bottom
action  of the other card in whatever order
they want.
We haven’t covered the specifics of how all the actions
work yet, but the plain‑text descriptions in the blue
boxes on the card  should give you a better idea of
their function. If you are unsure about what cards to
pick, try these suggestions for each character:

Hatchet Demolitionist
Center Mass One‑Two Punch
Double Throw Knock Out the Support
Voidwarden Red Guard
Suggestion Blinding Sickle
Wicked Scratch Shocking Advance

Choosing which of the two to be your initiative card,
however, is up to you. The round will be acted out from
low to high initiative, and, according to the special rules
for this scenario, the monsters will be acting on initiative
50, so the decision to make is whether you want to
go before the monsters (lower number) or after the
monsters (higher number).
Ignore the icons in the middle left of the cards  for
now. These will be discussed in Scenario 2.

### Ordering of Initiative

Once all players have selected their cards, flip over each
character’s cards to reveal their initiative. Determine
initiative order by comparing the initiative value of
each character’s initiative card and the initiative of the
monsters (this will always be 50 for Scenario 1). Then,
arrange the initiative order tokens from low to high
based on each of these initiatives.
If there is a tie between any character and monster,
the character goes first. If there is a tie between two
characters, the tie breaker is the initiative value of their
second card.
You are then ready to act out the round, starting with
the first figure in the initiative order — the one with the
lowest initiative.

### Character Turns

Once the initiative order is set, each figure will get a turn
in that order. On a character’s turn, they will perform
one top action and one bottom action. They cannot
perform two top actions or two bottom actions. Their
selection of which card to use for their initiative no
longer matters. They can use either card first, for either
its top or bottom action. An action (the entire half of a
card) must be performed in the order written, and then
the card is placed in the character’s discard pile, on the
left side of their character mat.
Actions may be composed of multiple abilities, with
each ability separated by an ability line (dotted line).
Any ability or action can be skipped.
We will now discuss the possible types of abilities so that
the first character in the order can take their turn. If the
Vermling Raiders are acting first, skip to “Monster Turns”
on p. 10, then return here when it is a character’s turn.

#### Move

A “Move  X” ability allows a figure to move
up to X hexes. The figure does not have to use
all movement points when performing a move
ability. Figures can move through their allies (characters
through characters, monsters through monsters),
though the movement can never end on an occupied
hex (a hex with another figure). Figures cannot move
through enemies, obstacles, or walls.

#### Attack

An “Attack  X” ability allows a figure to
cause one targeted enemy within their range
to suffer a base X amount of damage. Figures
cannot attack their allies unless otherwise specified.
There are two types of attacks: ranged and melee.
Ranged attacks are denoted by a “Range   X”
written under the attack, which means one
enemy within X hexes of the attacker can be
targeted by the attack. Range cannot be counted through
a wall. If the word ‘Range’ is not used under an ‘Attack’,
the attack is considered melee, which means it can only
target adjacent enemies unless otherwise specified.

The main difference between ranged and melee attacks,
other than what can be targeted, is that if a ranged
attack targets an enemy adjacent to the attacker,
the attack gains Disadvantage (see Advantage and
Disadvantage below).

#### Advantage and Disadvantage

Some effects, such as the conditions on the following
page, may cause an attack to gain either Advantage or
Disadvantage. If an attack has Advantage, the attacker
draws two attack modifier cards and applies whichever
one is better. If an attack has Disadvantage, the attacker
draws two cards and applies whichever one is worse.
An attack cannot have multiple instances of Advantage
or Disadvantage, and if an attack has both Advantage
and Disadvantage, they cancel each other out.
If a ranged attack is performed on an adjacent enemy,
the attack gains Disadvantage.

#### Attack Modifier Cards

Any time a figure performs an attack, the figure must
flip over one card from their attack modifier deck for
each separate target to modify the attack.
A numerical value should be added or subtracted
from the attack value.
A    card means the attack value should
be doubled.
A    card means the attack does no damage.
The    and    cards also have a shuffle symbol,
meaning if either is revealed, the whole deck should
be shuffled at the end of the round.

Each character has their own attack modifier deck, and
the monsters collectively share a deck. In Scenario 1, each
deck is the same, consisting of 20 cards: six    , five    ,
five    , one    , one    , one    , and one   .

#### Damage and Killing Monsters

After an attack is made and the final
attack value is calculated (modified first by
any bonuses and then the attack modifier
card) that amount of damage is suffered
by the target. In the case of a monster
suffering damage, place damage tokens
equal to the amount suffered on the stat
envelope in the section corresponding to
the number on the monster’s standee.

If there are then enough damage tokens to equal or exceed the monster’s
maximum hit point value (see p. 10), the monster is killed and removed
from the map. All tokens in the monster’s stat envelope section can then
be returned to the tray.

#### Line‑of‑Sight

When any figure is targeted by an
ability, the targeting figure must have
a clear line‑of‑sight to the target in
order to perform the ability. This is
established if a line can be drawn from
any part of the targeting figure’s hex
to any part of the target’s hex without
touching a wall line. Only walls block
line‑of‑sight. Obstacles and other
figures do not block line-of-sight.

The following rules, up to “Monster Turns” on the next page, are for more situational
character effects. Feel free to begin taking character turns now and simply refer back to
here when necessary. Then, continue on to “Monster Turns” on the following page when
initiative 50 comes up in the order and the monsters act, if they haven’t already.

#### Target

Some attacks are followed by a “Target   X”, which means the attacker
can target X number of different enemies within the attack’s range. It
is not possible to target the same enemy with multiple attacks from
the same ability. For each separate attack performed, a separate attack
modifier card is flipped.

#### Suffer Damage

Some abilities cause figures to suffer
damage without an attack being made.
This damage is not modified and is not
affected by line‑of‑sight.

#### Conditions

Conditions may be applied as their own ability or as the
effect of an attack. Even if an attack does no damage,
conditions are still applied. There are four conditions
applicable to Scenario 1— three negative and one
positive. If a condition is applied to a character, place
the corresponding token in the lower left section of their
character mat. If a condition is applied to a monster,
place the token on the stat envelope in the section
corresponding to the number on the monster’s standee.
These four conditions stay on the target until the end of
the target’s next full turn, which could be in the same
round or the subsequent round if they already had a turn
this round.

Negative Conditions:
Immobilize: The figure cannot perform any
Move abilities.
Stun: The figure cannot perform any abilities,
including moving or attacking.
Muddle: All of the figure’s attacks gain
Disadvantage.
Positive Condition:
Strengthen: All of the figure’s attacks
gain Advantage.

#### Heal

A “Heal  X” ability allows a figure to cause one ally
within the specified range or themselves to heal X
amount of damage. Characters heal damage by rotating
their hit point dial (the red side) up that amount. A
figure cannot heal above their maximum hit point value.

#### Granting Actions

The Voidwarden has abilities that grant actions to other
figures — both allies and enemies. The initial text of
such an ability specifies who the action is granted to as
a targeted effect, and then the granted action is detailed,
where all normal rules of attacking and moving are
applied. If a figure is granted an attack action, the figure
uses their own attack modifier deck, unless otherwise
specified. A figure granted an action does not take
another turn — they are performing the action on the
Voidwarden’s turn.

#### Self

Some abilities specify the target as “Self”. This
means that the figure using the ability is the only
possible target.

#### Destroying Obstacles

The Demolitionist has abilities that cause an obstacle
within a specified range to be destroyed, making the
hex(es) the obstacle occupied now traversable. Note that
some obstacles occupy more than one hex, depending
on the number of hexes the green border surrounds.
When an obstacle is destroyed, place
destruction tiles on each hex of the
destroyed obstacle, even if the hex is
out of range, to denote that they are
now normal traversable hexes.

### Monster Turns Monster Turns

On initiative 50, the Vermling Raiders will now all act. Any single set of monsters will always act on the same initiative. Any elite monsters will act first, in standee numerical order, and then any normal monsters will act, also in numerical order. When a monster acts, it carries out its entire turn before the next monster acts.

The specifics of how a monster carries out its turn are described on the next page and can be referenced as necessary, but the short version is that the monster will move its base move value (1) towards the closest character, and then attack with its base attack value (2) if they are adjacent to that character. These values are shown on the monster stat card, depicted below.

#### Monster Stat Cards

The monster stat card is an important repository of
information for the monsters you are fighting. These are
slipped into stat sleeves such that only one stat group is
showing. The set includes:
Monster name.
Level of the monster. Set this to “1” for all
scenarios discussed in this book, but it will
increase as characters become more powerful.
Stats for normal (white) monsters.
Stats for elite (gold) monsters.
Monster’s maximum hit point value,
which is the amount of damage it needs
to suffer to die.
Monster’s base move value, which is
the number of hexes it can move on
its turn.
Monster’s base attack value,
which is the value it will
use when attacking.

#### Monster Focus

Before a monster does anything else on its turn, the
monster will focus on one specific character to attack.
The focus will be the character the monster can perform
its attack against using the least amount of movement.
In Scenario 1, the monsters only attack from adjacency,
so the monster will find the shortest possible path to
get adjacent to a character, and then that character will
become the focus. If a character is already adjacent to
the monster, then that character becomes the focus, and
finding a path is not required. If multiple characters
can be reached in the same number of movements, the
monster focuses on the one earlier in the initiative order.

It does not matter whether the monster can reach the
end of its path this turn. So long as there is a path, given
infinite movement, to reach a hex to attack a character,
the monster will still focus on that character. Focus also
does not require line-of-sight.

It is possible a monster fails to find a focus because there
are no valid hexes it can move to in order to get adjacent
to any character. In this case, the monster does not move
or attack.

#### Monster Move

In this scenario, once the monster has a focus, it will
then move to get closer to its focus. If the monster
cannot get closer to its focus, either because it is already
adjacent or another monster is in its path, then it will
not move. If it is ever ambiguous where a monster will
move because it has multiple equally viable options, the
players decide which option to take.

#### Monster Attack

In this scenario, once the monster has moved, if it is
now adjacent to its focus, it will attack its focus. It does
so in the same way characters attack, with its base
attack value modified by an attack modifier card flipped
from the monster attack modifier deck. The targeted
character then suffers this amount of damage.
