# Obsession Rulebook

## Our Story

Changes are afoot in Derbyshire, England, where four families all possessed of eligible young gentlemen and ladies find themselves embroiled in romance and intrigue during a time of optimism. Fortune has recently smiled on these somewhat neglected estates, families with respectable histories that endured hard times in the late 18th century. Now, in the mid-19th, the families Asquith, Cavendish, Ponsonby, and York have coincidentally come into new sources of income and are intent on improving their country estates and restoring their failing reputations. The inflow of funds is modest, but there is a new optimism abroad in this part of Derbyshire!

The envy of this part of the county is Alderley Hall where Margaret, Dowager Countess Fairchild, and her sister-in-law, Ethel, reside with a joint income well in excess of 20,000 pa. Only their loneliness living on such a sprawling estate dampens the generous hearts of the two widowed and childless ladies.

Then, to their delight, they welcome new occupants: their dashing nephew Charles and lovely niece Elizabeth, sadly not far removed from tragedy. Their parents, returning from holiday in the south of France, perished crossing the Channel in suddenly ill weather. The death of Margaret's brother-in-law and his lady has brought Charles and Elizabeth permanently to the Fairchild residence, far from their childhood estate in Yorkshire. Of course, the irrepressible Fairchild ladies, now a year removed from the terrible accident, know precisely what is the best medicine for a sad heart: romance! And the surrounding hills are awash in prime matchmaking material. The nearby Derbyshire families all have marriageable children, and the Fairchild ladies have designs!

## Glossary Info

This *Obsession* Rulebook enables rapid set up and gameplay. The game also comes with a separate alphabetised Glossary where detailed explanations can be found beyond the scope of this Rulebook. Every highlighted term in *Blue* the reader encounters in these pages has a corresponding Glossary entry.

The Glossary provides thematic content and should also be used whenever necessary to clarify rules described in brief here. Note that game variations are presented in the Glossary under *Variations*. The Glossary is a critical adjunct to this Rulebook if one is seeking to get the most out of the game of *Obsession*!

## Player Area Setup (standard play)

Rules for four *Obsession* variants can be found in the Glossary under *Variations*

First Player Rules Summary

### SETUP

A player is randomly assigned the 1st player marker. Starting with the person to the left of the 1st player and going clockwise, players choose a family board (the first player will get last choice).

### DURING THE GAME

At the end of each courtship season, the 1st player pawn is passed ***counterclockwise*** (to the player's right).

1. Decide who will be the starting player and give him or her the purple 1st player pawn.

   IMPORTANT: Player Area setup must take place before Central Play Area setup (detailed on pages 4 and 5).

   ***Family Bonus: Family Ponsonhy begins the game with £300. Place coins totaling 300 on or near the player board.***

2. Beginning with the player to the left of the 1st player and moving clockwise, choose a family *Player Board*.  
**Note:** The only gameplay difference between player boards is the starting *Family Bonus* (which is described in the lower right-hand corner of each board).

3. Each family gets four reputation wheel counters (two-sided circular chits). Players place the chit with the number 1 face up on the board as shown and set the rest nearby the player board for later use.

   **EXTENDED PLAY:** If playing an *Extended Play* game, an additional 7/8 reputation wheel counter is used and set near the player board.

4. Place a reputation wheel marker on position 1 of the wheel. ***Family Bonus: Family Cavendish starts on position 4.***

5. Each family acquires the S starting servant meeples (the blue *Butler*, red *Housekeeper*, green *Valet*, purple *Lady's Maid*, and white *Footman* and places them in Available Service on the player board as shown). ***Family Bonus: Family York begins the game with an extra footman.***

6. Place a *Country Estate Organiser* near the player board, either below as shown here or to one side (shown on the next page). Leave room below the organiser for additional tiles. Alternatively, players may use the back side of the player board, which has an integrated organiser.

7. Each family starts with the same 5 *Improvement Tiles*, which are distinguished by a building icon in the upper right-hand corner on only one side. Place the tiles as shown with the building icon visible.

8. Each family begins with the same four family members: a husband and wife, heir, and daughter. Frequently, estate names differ from the family's last name. Note, however, that each family member shares the same crest as on their player board, and above that crest is the 1st letter of the family name. Locate the family cards, which will be the first cards in the player's gentry deck. ***Family bonus: Family Asquith begins with a fifth family member, a Dowager Countess aunt.***

9. The 15 Starter Guests have a crown in the upper left-hand corner of the card.

   Randomly deal two starter guests to each player. These two close family friends are combined with the four family cards to form the player's starting *Gentry Deck*.

   Alternatively, players can use a Starter Guest card draft to choose these guests. See *Variations*, page 26 in the Glossary.

10. Each player is dealt five *Objective Cards*, keeping them all. Over the course of the game, players will discard objectives that are less desirable, finishing with and scoring three.

   **EXTENDED PLAY:** Each player is dealt four *Objective Cards*, keeping them all. Over the course of the game, players will discard objectives that are less desirable, finishing with and scoring four.

#### Objective Cards (OC)

**DISCARDING BAD OBJECTIVES DURING THE GAME**

*In standard play, players begin the game with five objective cards. In season one (first four rounds), players evaluate their objectives, discarding the worst card after the Season 1 courtship.*

*Early in Season 2 (round 6), players draw and keep two more cards. At the end of each of the next three courtships, players discard a card (getting rid of a total of four), settling on the three best scoring objectives after the final courtship.*

### Central Play Area Setup

Setup shown is for a two-player, standard length game

For each step below, locate the corresponding number icon in the layout graphic. Please recall that any term in *Blue* is a Glossary term (where additional detail is provided).

Place the supply board in the centre of the playing area where it will be easily accessible by all players. Populate the supply board as follows:

1. **Servants for Hire**: The Servants for Hire box on the supply board holds extra servants that may be hired during the game. The number of servants varies depending on the number of players. Populate servants on the supply board as follows:
   * **2 Players:** 2 *Underbutlers*, 4 *Footmen*, 2 *Valets*, 2 *Lady's Maids*
   * **3 Players:** 2 *Underbutlers*, 6 footmen, 3 valets, 3 lady's maids
   * **4 Players:** 2 *Underbutlers*, 8 footmen, 4 valets, 4 lady's maids

   **IMPORTANT:** The underbutler pawn(s) are stored in the Servants for Hire area, but the underbutler is not acquired in the same fashion as footmen, valets, and lady's maids, who are hired by the butler in the *Butler's Room*. The underbutler is only hired when a *Butler's Pantry* service tile is purchased from the Builders' Market; then and only then is the underbutler taken from the Servants for Hire area.

2. **Objective Cards:** Each player was dealt objective cards during player setup. Place the remaining objective cards on the supply board as shown.

3. **£100 and £500 Coins:** Thirty-five (35) £100 coins and eleven (11) £500 coins come with the game. Place a sufficient supply of coins as indicated. This supply is the bank; favours are taken from here, and purchases are paid into here. Money is not limited; if players run out of coins, use a suitable substitute.

4. **Casual Guests:** The supply board holds two decks of *Gentry Cards* - casual guests and
prestige guests. The symbol for casual guests is one *Fleur-de-lis* in the upper
left-hand corner of the gentry card (below the prestige rating). Each player
received two *Starter Guests* during player setup; these starter guests are a subset of
casual guests and will be used during the game. Combine the remaining starter guests
with the 35 regular casual guests, thoroughly shuffle, and place as shown.

5. Prestige Guests: The symbol for prestige guests is two fleur-de-lis.
Shuffle the 25 prestige guests and place as indicated.

6. Improvement Tiles: Except for monuments, place all improvement tiles in the
purple tile bag. Monuments are then added based upon player count:
 * 2 Players: Sculpture Garden +  2 other tiles of choice
 * 3 Players: Sculpture Garden + 3 other tiles of choice
 * 4 Players: Five monument tiles of choice

Note: As an alternative to the high VP value of the Sculpture Garden,
players can exclude it from the game or, if an Estate monument is desired,
substitute the Garden Maze in its place.

7. Round Track: Place the round track near the supply board with the white pawn on
the 1st square as shown. The side with 16 rounds is *Standard Play*. The side with
20 rounds is *Extended Play*.

Shuffle the *Victory Point Cards* and place them on the round track where indicated.



Central Play Asea Setup
Setup shown is for a two player, standard length game

7. CONTINUED: Shuffle the *Theme Cards* thoroughly and place on the round
track as shown. Place *Reminder Tiles* equal to the number of players nearby.

Place the cards representing *Charles and Elizabeth Fairchild* near the round track.
These cards are easily identified either by name or by the purple frame (and unique
crest) in the upper left-hand corner of both cards.

8. Builder's Market: For initial population of the market, only improvement tiles
with a *Prestige Rating* of 1, 2, and 3 along with four of the service tiles can be
used (Brushing Room, Barn, Butler's Pantry, and Servant's Quarters); these are
the tiles that qualify for initial population.

Qualifying tiles are then drawn to fill the Builders' Market
for the 1st time. Draw out six qualifying tiles, returning
any excluded tiles to the bag.

TILES THAT QUALIFY FOR INITIAL POPULATION
Tiles with a prestige rating of 1, 2, 3
(including the Heritage Guest Suite)
Brushing Room service tile
Barn service tile
Butler's Pantry service tile
Servant's Quarters service tile

TILES EXCLUDED FROM INITIAL POPULATION
Tiles with a prestige rating of 4, 5, 6
(including the Queen's Suite and Lionheart Suite)
Servants' Hall service tile
All monuments

Every tile possesses a Tile Sorting Number (TSN) as
shown to the right (the TSN is circled in yellow). Once
six qualifying tiles have been drawn, place them in
ascending TSN order, left to right, in the Builder's Market
(if a duplicate qualifying tile is drawn, it is stacked on top
of its matching tile in the market). Setup is now complete.

AN EXAMPLE OF THE TILE SORTING NUMBER SYSTEM
(below is an example of populating the market after initial
population during a game when all tiles are in use)

005 020 080 085 140 145



Goal and Flow of the Game (round track and round track icons)

Goal of the Game

Each player is the head of a respected but troubled family estate in
Victorian Britain. After several lean decades, family fortunes are
looking up. The player's objective is to renovate a neglected
country estate, rehabilitate the family's tarnished reputation,
and improve the marriage prospects of eligible children. A
primary goal will be to form an attachment with the wealthy
and influential Fairchild family.

Successful actions taken to restore the family's standing
amongst the Derbyshire social elite are measured in
victory points (VP). There are seven sources of these VPs,
and they represent:

* An appealing country estate (26.7%)
* The best social connections (21.6%)
* Superior reputation in the county (16.6%)
* A large and well-trained domestic staff (13.3%)
* Private family achievements (11.1%)
* Successful courtship of a Fairchild (8.3%)
* Wealth (2.4%)

It is recommended that
players review page 15 of
this Rulebook (end game
scoring) to understand how VP are
awarded for each of these sources.



Courtship and Winning
GAME TIP
Courtship is the focus of each
season in Obsession. It is unlikely
you can successfully ignore courtship
to focus on buying improvement
tiles or building your deck.
Yet winning the hand of a Fairchild
counts for less than 15 of total
victory points on average. This
should remind everyone that if the
courtship goes against you, you
are wise to identify a strength
(money, prestige guest invites,
reachable objectives) and go 100%
in that direction. Chasing a
courtship that is out of reach
usually ensures defeat.

If Charles or Elizabeth doesn't like
your family, become a Warleggan!
Build, cultivate friends, hoard
money! You can still win...

Flow of the Game (Round Track)
The number of rounds is controlled by the *Round Track* (front and
back pictured on page 7). There are two features to the round track
that control gameplay: *Seasons* and Rounds.

Seasons
The standard and extended length games both encompass four seasons. 
In a standard length game, one season is three rounds (purple spaces) where *Activities*
happen (such as hosting social events, hiring servants, and
renovating your estate) ending in a courtship round showing an icon
of a Victorian couple. No activities of any type occur during a
courtship round; only courtship is evaluated.

*Courtship* is described in detail on page 13, but it is important to
note that a *Theme Card* is revealed at the beginning of each season
before any actions are taken (open courtship). That theme provides
insight into the interests and passions of Charles and Elizabeth
Fairchild, the objects of the competitive courtship.


In summary, each seasonal courtship is three things:
1) Players learn what interests the Fairchild
siblings (theme card is revealed)
2) Players court Charles and Elizabeth
by pursuing activities that will gain
their attention (actions taken on purple spaces)
3) Courtship is then evaluated with the most successful
player(s) being rewarded with favors and perhaps a visit from
one of the Fairchilds for the next season (courtship is scored).

Standard Rounds (Purple Spaces)

When the white pawn is advanced to a new purple round
space, two things can happen:
1) The round space may have a symbol showing a special
event (village fair, national holiday, etc.). Players then follow
specific rules for such special events:

Village Fair: Players who have flipped the Study tile
receive two reputation and £300 at the start of this round.
See Study Tile, Glossary page 23.

Courtship Event: Service is not refreshed and no activity
takes place. Players who possess a Servants Hall do not
gossip. Players who possess Monuments do not gain
reputation. Only a courtship event is resolved this round.
Sec Rulebook page 13.

Objective Card Draw: At the beginning of each player's
turn, two objective cards are drawn and added to the
objectives already in hand. See *Objective Cards*,
Glossary page 16.

Builders Holiday: Players are permitted to purchase as
many tiles from the market as resources allow. This
includes tiles located in the Builders Market Reserve.
Sec Builders Holiday, Glossary page S.

National Holiday: Player reputation does not limit actions
this round. Players are permitted to host any activity and
any guests during the holiday (as if reputation were at
Max). See National Holiday, Glossary page 16.

End Game Scoring: Using the scoring pad, players total
their victory points by category and declare a winner. See
Rulebook page 1S.

2) The round space requires each player in turn order to either host one
activity or pass. This is a standard player turn. Beginning on page 8, the
standard player turn is described in great detail. After a player has hosted
an activity or passed (see Passing), the next player in clockwise order does
the same. When every player has hosted one activity or passed, the round
track marker is advanced to the next space on the round track.



The Round Track (standard & extended play, beginning the game)

Standard Play vs. Extended Play

Before beginning a game, players must decide between *Standard Play* and *Extended
Play*. Obsession's *Round Track* is two-sided and features a standard length 16-round
game on one side and an extended length 20-round game on the reverse. The games differ
by more that just four player rounds. Extended play contains two additional icons on the
round track that impact gameplay: an extra village fair (see *Study Tile*) and an additional
*Objective Card* draw.

Also, an additional reputation counter is used during extended play, allowing for significantly
more Reputation Victory Points. The reputation wheel counters needed for
standard play and extended play are shown next to each round track on this page. The
counters showing 1, 3, 5, and 7 are two-sided with 2, 4, 6, and 8 on the reverse sides. The
Max tile (with the flag) is the same on both sides and represents 7 in the standard game
and 9 in the extended game. It is placed after the highest number as the final tile.

The impact on end game scoring is dramatic. This can be seen in the reputation victory
point charts located next to each round track (the victory points accumulate in a
triangular number sequence, meaning the numeric value of each level is added to all the
previous levels to determine victory points).

In general, extended play allows for:
 * Greater development of the country estate
 * An opportunity to host more elaborate *Activities* with numerous guests
 * Increased likelihood for completion of the most difficult Objective Cards
 * Dramatically higher player reputations.
Note: budget an extra 10 minutes per player for extended play.

Builder's Market Reserve and the Round Track

The round track is primarily used to track player tums and manage the seasonal
*Courtship*. It is also used to remind players when the *Builder's Market Reserve* begins
for both service tiles and tiles with a prestige rating of 1.

Standard Play

| Family Reputation Level | End Game Victory Points |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
|  1  |  1 |
|  2  |  3 |
|  3  |  6 |
|  4  | 10 |
|  5  | 15 |
|  6  | 21 |
| Max | 28 |

Extended Play

| Family Reputation Level | End Game Victory Points |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
|  1  |  1 |
|  2  |  3 |
|  3  |  6 |
|  4  | 10 |
|  5  | 15 |
|  6  | 21 |
|  7  | 28 |
|  8  | 36 |
| Max | 45 |

A reserve reminder, located beneath the second and third *Season* of both round tracks
(example circled in yellow above), indicates when players should 'Begin Service Tile
Reserve' and 'Begin PR 1 Tile Reserve'. These reserves are locations on the large supply
board to hold all service tiles and tiles with a prestige rating of I at certain times in the
game. For more detail on the Builders Market in general and the tile reserves in particular,
consult the Glossary pages 5 & 6. For now, it is important to note that at the beginning of
Season 2 and for the remainder of the game, all service tiles are placed in the Service Tile
Reserve on the main supply board; similarly, at
the beginning of Season 3 and for the remainder
of the game, all tiles that have a prestige rating of
1 are placed in the PR (prestige rating) 1 Tile
Reserve on the main supply board.

Beginning the Game

The game begins with the white pawn on the
round tracks first space (labelled
START). Every player completes
one standard turn (see next page) in
clockwise order before the round
track pawn is advanced. Some round
spaces have a labelled icon indicating
an event (refer to page 6 of this
rulebook for an explanation of these
icons).

Reveal Courtship Theme: At the
start of each season, a *Theme Card*
located on the round track is
revealed. This theme will be one of
the five *Country Estate Organiser*
categories; players will attempt to
develop the revealed theme by
playing and purchasing improvement
 tiles that fall into this courtship
category.

Courtship Variations

OPEN COURTSHIP
The default courtship rules call for
an open courtship, which means
that a theme card is revealed at the
beginning of a season; players
then develop their country estates
with knowledge of the Fairchild
siblings preferences.

VARIATIONS

There are two main courtship
i variations (see the Glossary, pages
25 & 26) where the theme is either
revealed at the end of the season
(closed courtship) or as
determined by the roll of a dice
(variable courtship). Gameplay is
dramatically impacted by these
variations, and you are encouraged
to explore them!




Playing the Game (rotating service, hosting an activity, inviting guests, providing service)

A Standard Turn

Starting with the 1st player, players follow the eight steps outlined on every player
board (see board immediately below). In some circumstances, players will pass, which
has unique rules. *Passing* will be discussed at the end of this 8-step section.

1 Rotate Service: Each player performs this action after turn 1 (on turn 1, no
servants have yet been used, so this step is ignored):
 * FIRST: Move servants residing in
the Servants Quarters area to the
Available Service area (spaces
located at the bottom of each player
board). These servants are now
available for the current turn.
 * SECOND: Move servants in the
Expended Service area to the Servants Quarters io rest. These servants are
unavailable for the current turn.

2. Check Round Track, Monuments, and Servant's Hall: There are three types
of game actions that need to be checked before a player begins her turn.
 * Check the *Round Track* space for special events, which are discussed on page
6 of this rulebook. If a symbol is present, follow the instructions for the event.
 * If the player owns Monuments, she immediately takes reputation equal to
the number of Monuments on display in her organiser.
 * If the player owns the Servants Hall, she may deploy a servant to the hall
located in the organiser; follow the Servants Hall instructions on page 11.

3. Host Activity: Each *Improvement Tile* represents a room or outside space at
your country estate. Listed on each tile in white print below the tile name is the
*Activity* you can host in that space. Choose an activity to host by selecting an
improvement tile from the *Country Estate Organiser*. Not sure which activity to
choose? Consult the Strategy Guide. Place the improvement tile on your Player Board
in the square labelled Activity. Note: A servant hiring action in the Butler's Room is a
unique option for an activity to host; see Hiring Servant Activity on page 10.

Critical Rule 1 (red arrow): At the beginning of Step 3, the largest number on the player
board (reputation) must be - the largest number on the improvement tile chosen.
Note: Special Actions (more on these later) may be taken during a turn that cause
reputation to fall below the large tile number (Prestige Rating). Critical Rule 2 yellow
arrow): The servant indicated by the servant icon on the tile must be in your Available
Service box on your player board (unless the player has the Servants Quarters tile or
refreshes a servant via special actions*).
Announce the activity you are hosting to the other player(s);
there are no secrets in Derbyshire society.

4. Invite Guests: Your Gentry Cards represent the potential guests you may
invite to your activity. Note: Gentry is a term that refers to people of good
social position just below nobility; all large playing cards are gentry.

The tile just placed on the player board tells what type of guests must be invited to the
activity chosen. The player must supply the exact number and type of gentry
indicated on the tile or the activity cannot be hosted
(there are five possibilities: gentry, family, gentlemen, ladies, and a
particular type of guest). The player chooses cards from her Active Hand that satisfy this
instruction (cards in her Discard Pile are unavailable until the player passes).

Critical Rule 1 (red arrows): At the beginning of
Step 3, the largest number on your player board
must be the top left number on the gentry card;
actions may be taken during a turn that cause reputation
to fall below the card number (prestige rating). Note: Family and the Fairchilds
may attend any activity - treat them as if they had a prestige rating of 1, although it
would actually be much higher. Critical Rule 2 (yellow arrows). You must have the
servant indicated by the servant icon on the card in the Available Service box on your
player board. Place the cards below the player board.

5 Provide Service: There will always be a coloured icon of a servant on an
improvement tile (that can be played) and frequently on a gentry card; take the
matching servants from Available Service and place them on the
improvement tile and gentry cards.

Critical Rule 1: All service is mandatory. If a servant is not available or
acquired via special action (or the player does not possess the Servants Quarters
service tile), that activity or guest is not eligible.

Here, a footman is placed on the Tennis Court tile, a
valet on the guest card of the Honourable Albert
Plantagenet, and a lady's maid on the guest card of
Miss Anne Harlow.



Playing the Game (special servant abilities, enjoying favours)

5. Provide Service, continued: There are three servants who can stand in for
other servants under certain circumstances: the housekeeper, underbutler, and
footman.

Housekeeper: Every player begins the game with a Housekeeper; there are
several tiles and a few elite guests where she is the required servant.
Ability: The housekeeper may also stand in for a lady's maid when there are no
lady's maids available. This is an innate ability and does not require a service tile.

Underbutler: There are at most only two Underbutlers in any
game of Obsession, and they are kept in the Servants for Hire
section of the supply board along with the extra valets, lady's E
maids, and footmen. The underbutler can only be hired if a
player acquires the Butler's Pantry service tile from the Builder's
Market. When that tile is purchased, it is placed into the player's
country estate organiser; the player also takes an underbutler from the supply and puts
him in the Expended Service area on his player board. Ability: The underbutler may
serve in the capacity of any male servant Butler, valet, or footman) at any time, even
if the other servant is available. Note: The Butler's Pantry service tile has been standardised for
use with the Upstairs. Downstairs expansion, which has two new male servants: the hall boy and useful
man. The underbutler may stand in for the hall boy, but not the useful man, who is a specialised servant)

Footman: Every player begins the game with a Footman, and
more are available from the supply. The footmen is the required
servant on Several tiles and for a few guests. Ability: A footman B
may also stand in for a Valet when there are no valets available,
if the player has acquired the Brushing Room service tile from the
Builders Market. Once the Brushing Room is acquired and placed in the player's
organiser, all current and future footmen have this ability. Unlike the Butler's Pantry
tile, the Brushing Room tile does not grant the player a footman; footmen are hired
from the supply using a standard hiring action (see next page).

6. Enjoy Favours: Successfully hosting an Activity at one's country estate
benefits the family. Consider the following example:

Mabel, Countess of Ponsonby, received three distinguished visitors in the
beautifully renovated Ponsonby drawing room: the stern Caroline, Viscountess
Abernathy; the mysterious Istvan, Count Hoyos; and Anne Marie, Comtesse de Vitry,
the wife of o French noble and a new acquaintance. The conversation was lively and
wide-ranging: the Ponsonby family learned of key investment
opportunities in France and Eastern Europe; Count Istvan fell in
love with the estate grounds and enthusiastically accepted a
return invitation to hunt when the weather turned, promising to
bring along two close friends from London, and the neighbouring
estates took notice of the fine carriages that visited.

The benefits resulting from an afternoon receiving distinguished visitors at the
Ponsonby estate are called favours; most Improvement Tiles and all Gentry Cards
yield them. These favours are of three types: money in pounds (£), reputation.
and invitations to new guests.

The player acquires these favours in the following order:

1) Total the pounds listed on all sources (tiles and gentry cards) and take coins from
the supply representing that total. In the example at the lower left, the player would
take coins from the supply totaling £400.

Note: There are a class of guests called paupers, who cost the hosting family £100 or
£200 if they attend an activity. A player must be able to pay this amount of money to
the bank in order to invite a pauper. The money is paid during the Enjoy Favours
step, so a player may either use other pound favours from the activity to account for,
the pauper or use a Special Action to acquire the necessary pounds. If the player
cannot generate pounds to cover the £ penalty, the pauper cannot attend.

2) Total the reputation listed on all sources and add this total to the family's
reputation (each lion rampant 8 is worth one space on the reputation wheel). Note:
Once a player crosses over top from 5 to 1, find the circular chit with the next highest
number in sequence and flip/replace the current chit.

In the example, the player would gain 5 reputation, and she
would move the reputation wheel marker in a clockwise
direction around the circular chit showing her current reputation
level. She would move from the 3 to the 4 to the Sat which
time she would cross over top and return to the 1, flipping the reputation wheel
counter to a 4 before continuing two more positions for a total of five reputation
added. She would finish at a reputation of level 4 (the large number), position 3 (the
small number), one complete revolution around the wheel.

Young Lady Admirer Bonus: The young lady of each family
possesses a reputation favour that is only taken when she attends
an activity along with a male prestige guest; see the Glossary
page 4 for details.

Note: There are guests who impose a reputation penalty. When paying a
penalty, the player moves counterclockwise on the reputation wheel; if,
in doing this, the player would ‘cross over' the top of the wheel (from
number I back to number S), then she must flip/replace the counter to
show the next lowest reputation level. Exception: If the player has no
reputation (level I, position 1), she may invite guests with negative reputation without
paying the penalty; being so disreputable themselves, the family is free to consort
with other unsavory characters. If it is possible to pay a partial penalty (i.e., player is
at level I, position 2 with Miss Hawkins above attending an activity), the player must
pay whatever penalty is possible until they reach the lowest reputation level.

3) Invite/dismiss gentry as indicated on all sources. Cards taken from the supply
(prestige or Casual Guests) are placed into the player's Active Hand. In this exam-
ple, the successful activity has captured the interest of two casual guests and one
Prestige Guest. The player takes the top prestige guest and the top casual
guest (the friends of Count Hoyos), and then, using the Countess's ability, looks at the
next two casual guests, keeping one and returning the rejected guest to the bottom of
the casual guest deck. The player shows her new connections to the other players
(there are no secrets in Derbyshire society), and puts them into her active hand.



Playing the Game (unusual favours, buying from Builders Market)

6. Enjoy Favours, continued: The lady
of the house has unique icons. When
this card is used, the player has a
choice between two actions: either look at
iwo casual guests, keeping one (circled in red,
the favour used on the previous page) or
dismiss any guest (circled in yellow). On
cards, only the lady of each family has this
ability, but the favour is found on most estate
improvement tiles. The dismiss guest favour
is the only favour that is not mandatory; when
a dismiss guest favour is
available, the player may
optionally use that favour if
there is a guest they wish to
remove from their gentry
deck. See Dismiss Guest in
the Glossary page 9).

Are Favours Mandatory?

There are three main favours:
money in pounds, reputation, and
invitations to new guests.
All these favours are mandatory,
with one exception: dismissal (a
subset of invitations). The
opposite of an invitation is a
dismissal, and this is the one
favour that is optional. Only one
gentry card possesses this favour
(the lady of each house), but most
Estate improvement tiles have it.
The rules governing dismissals are
involved (see Glossary, page 9),
but three important ones stand out:
 * Any guest (no family) may be dismissed.
 * One can dismiss a guest who attended the
activity that granted the dismissal favour.
 * One can dismiss a guest in your active hand or discard pile.

Unusual Favours (VP Card, Gossip)

A few select guests have favours that do not
fall into the three main categories (money,
reputation, invitations/ dismissals).

Victory Point Card Favour: Elite guests can
have such an impact on the family's quest to
restore their social standing that a VP Card
(normally used in courtship) is awarded. VP
Cards offer a choice between a
favour and end game victory
points. Players take a VP Card
from the supply on the round
track and use it in the same
way they would a courtship VP
Card (see Courtship page 13).


Gossip: Some casual guests of questionable reputation tend to gossip.
On those cards is seen a favour that uses the word attack. This favour
allows the player to choose another player about whom to spread
damaging gossip. The targeted player decreases the reputation on his
player board by the amount shown in the attack favour, but the gossiping
player does not increase her reputation. Note: Some gossips are so
unsavory that they also damage the family's reputation (as seen here
with Miss Oliver), while others do not (they are not yet widely known to be a gossip).

Hiring Servant Activity (and Favour)

The Enjoy Favours step in the Order of Play on every player board references a fourth
favour in the shape of a servant. This favour is only available through the use of one
tile, the Butler's Room START tile.

Instead of hosting a social activity in Step 3, a player can hire servants by selecting the
Butler's Room tile. The Butler is the required servant (although the Underbutler may
serve in this role), and the action is to take two servants of choice from the supply (the
Servants for Hire area). Any combination of Valets, Lady's
Maids, or Footmen may be taken (this excludes the
underbutler, who can only be acquired with the purchase of
the Butler's Pantry service tile).

Players can also use the back side of the Butler's Room tile
(pictured here, showing the rose in the upper right corner) to
recruit one servant from another player; the player takes one
valet, lady's maid, or footman from any location on another players board. The loyal
butler, underbutler, and Housekeeper cannot be recruited as they would never
consider such an offer. The Butler's Room is the only tile used for an activity (.e.,
placed on the player board) where no gentry cards are played.

Critical Rule: Hired/recruited servants must be placed in Expended Service on the
player board with the butler or underbutler (whoever did the hiring) to be oriented to
their new household.

7. Buy from the Builders Market. The Builders' Market is the eight spaces
on the central supply board where improvement tiles available for purchase
are located (six spaces in the active market, two spaces in the reserve). These
tiles represent potential capital additions or renovations to a country house and
its surrounding grounds. In a standard round (excluding courtship rounds), each
player is permitted to purchase one improvement tile from the market using pounds
saved or acquired as part of a current activity (on the Builders Holiday, players can
purchase as many improvements as they can afford).

One does not have to buy from the market and can instead choose to save
coins (pounds) on their Player board for future purchases.

Market rules are as follows:

Rule I: Only one purchase per turn. The exception is the Builders' Holiday on
the round track (round 11 in Standard Play and round 13 in Extended Play).
During this holiday, a player can purchase as many tiles as she can afford.
Rule 2: Players cannot purchase duplicate improvement tiles.
Rule 3. Pay the bank (£ supply pile on
the supply board) the amount fixed in
the Builder's Market above the tile as
well as any -- modifier on the tiles
themselves located in the upper
right-hand corner. Tiles that represent a
more modest capital improvement are
discounted (-£) and tiles that represent a
significant capital improvement show a
premium pound amount (+£).




Playing the Game (more buying from the builders' market, unique tiles)

7. Buy from the Builders Market, continued.

Rule 4: Place newly purchased tiles in the Country Estate Organiser in the
proper column (by colour/type) face-up (the back side of the tile contains a
rose in the upper right-hand corner; no rose should be visible). Note: Service
and Monument Tiles are the same on both sides and never removed from the
country estate organiser. If the Servants Hall or a monument is purchased, take
a Reminder Tile if you do not already have one and place it on the player
board, it serves to remind players to take the reputation bonus on future turns.
Players are also reminded by the Order of Play on each player board.

Rule 5: After purchasing a tile, slide the remaining tiles to the left, exposing the
rightmost spot in the Builders Market. Draw a tile from the tile bag and place
it there. If during the Builders Holiday more than one tile is purchased,
populate only the open spaces in Tile Sorting Number order, lowest to the left,
highest to the right. Tiles that belong in the Builders' Market Reserve should be
handled according to market population rules discussed on the next page.

Rule 6:  If a duplicate tile is drawn, it is stacked on top of the same tile already
in the market. If a player purchases one of the tiles, the duplicate remains
available for another player to purchase. If the market is refreshed, both tiles are
removed from the market to make room for new tiles.

Rule 7. Players are permitted to purchase any tile they can afford, even if the
Prestige Rating is above the family's reputation.

Tile Types

There are four types of tiles that will appear in the market: standard Improvement
Tiles, Suites Expansion Tiles, service tiles, and monument tiles. All are capital
improvements of the country estate, but each functions differently.

Improvement Tile: A tile used to Host Activities on subsequent
turns. Hosting activities involves removing the tile from the organiser
and placing it on the player board. These tiles are the most common
and contain the physical location, the activity that can be hosted,
guests to invite, a graphic icon of the servant required, and the favours to be enjoyed.
Once used for the first time, the tile is flipped (showing a rose). Once flipped, the tile
is never flipped again (unless it is a Hybrid Tile, see Rulebook page 12).

Suites Expansion Tile: These tiles are a hybrid of an improvement
tile (front side) and a monument tile (back side, except for the
Heritage Suite). They are unique in that one guest can be invited to
1 stay overnight at the country estate with enhanced favours. See the
next page and the Glossary entry on page 23 for details.

Service Tile: A tile placed in the organiser and never moved from
there (the Butlers Room, which is played, is a START tile). All five
service tiles grant service-related, permanent benefits that the player
enjoys for the rest of the game (indicated by the circular arrow icon).

Monument Tile: A tile placed in the organiser and never moved
- from there. These tiles represent prestigious decorative improvements
of the players estate that increase reputation over time. For
Æ each subsequent turn, the player increases her reputation by one
step on the reputation wheel for each monument in her organiser.

Unique Tile Rules

There are several tiles that possess unique rules and are worth reviewing here:

Barn: On all future turns when a tile from the
ESTATE category is played ( same color/pattern
as the Fenced Paddock here), the player
increases his reputation by one on his player
board reputation wheel. This reputation increase
is taken during the Enjoy Favours step.

Servants Hall: At the beginning of a turn during Step 2, the
player with the Hall may place any available servant - the source
of rumours - onto the tile. The targeted player reduces her
reputation by one, while the player with the Hall increases his
reputation by one. The gossiping servant is then placed into
Expended Service and rotated normally in future turns. Once
Stop 3 (Host Activity) begins, the player cannot use the Hall.

Private Study: The study is a location where
family members gather to plan and manage the
estate. One such effort is planning for the
 annual fair in the village located on family
property. The tile is played on a standard turn,
and the activity that is hosted is Village Fair
Planning.

If a family plans for successful fairs, then at the beginning of
the turn (Step 2) featuring the village fair icon, the player's
reputation increases by two (the reputation wheel marker is
incremented by 2) and revenue of £300 is gained. Fairs take
place twice during a standard game and three times during an extended play game.
The Study tile can be used once; when the activity is hosted, the Study tile is
flipped to reveal this permanent benefit, which applies to all future fairs.

If the Village Fair Planning activity does not take place, no added revenues are
enjoyed by the family and their reputation in the local community is not enhanced,
however, the player retains the 3 victory points showing on the front side of the
tile, which reflect the family's dedication to high society rather than village
stewardship.

Main Library: Essentials tiles have a powerful
benefit - number of guests. This can be seen in
parties of 5, 6, 7, and more, a direct path to
hugely favourable events. The Main Library,
however, is a unique tile in that it is reserved for
family and generates two unique favours: an
objective card draw on the front side, and a victory point card draw on the back.

The Main Library objective card draw differs from the draw(s) on the round track
in that the player only takes the top objective card from the supply. This card is an
additional scoring objective; in a standard game, players score three objective
cards (four in an extended game). A Main Library objective is in addition to these
totals. On the back of the tile, the favour is a victory point card draw from the top
of the VP card deck.




Playing the Game (more unique tiles, market reserve, special actions)

7. Buy from the Builders Market (continuing with market tiles that possess
unique rules).

Unique Tile Rules (continued)

Hybrid Tiles: Hybrid tiles are a unique 2nd printing bonus tile. The tile refers to a
room or outdoor space that is multi-purpose. As a result, the type of the tile changes
with the activity (the front is a different colour/category than the back).

These are the unique hybrid tile rules:

 * The white flower icon with the line underneath is the front side
of the tile; this is the side that will be face-up in the market and
the side that will be placed into the organiser when purchased
(under the appropriate tile category). The front-side VP would
count, if needed, towards a courtship in that category.
 * The colour on the opposite side is previewed as the pattern
behind the servant icon.
 * After the tile is used to host an activity (played onto the player
board), it flips and is placed into the new tile category (for
example, the Green Room above starts out as an ESSENTIALS
tile and, after being used to host a Philanthropy
Meeting, it is flipped and placed under the PRESTIGE category
in the organiser; the Green Room then counts towards a
PRESTIGE courtship, if needed).
 * If a tile is used to host an activity a second time, it is again
flipped and relocates under the original tile category. Thus the
hybrid tile mechanism allows it to be flipped back and forth
between two categories in response to courtship developments.

Suites Expansion Tiles: There are three suites tiles, two of which have unique rules:
the Queen's Suite and the Lionheart Suite. These tiles double favours and convert
into a monument after they have been used one time.

The Queen's Suite permits the invitation
of one prestige guest from the player's Active
Hand and has the effect of doubling one favour of
that guest (player's choice). Service is required
for the guest. Once played, the tile flips and
converts into a monument.

The Lionheart Suite allows the player to invite a
prestige guest not currently in her gentry deck to
stay al the estate. The player selects the top
stays in the Lionheart Suite; all favours of this
guest are doubled. The player does NOT provide
service to this guest; the butler coordinates perfect hospitality for this visitor. This
tile can be used for this action only one time, as it converts to a monument tile once
used. This new guest then is placed into the player's discard pile.

Builders' Market Reserve

During a game, the Builders Market Reserve will activate twice.
The purpose of the reserve is to remove low-value tiles from the
market as player reputations rise.

Service Tile Reserve: After the 1st courtship is over, the Service Tile
Reserve activates, and the following steps are then taken:
 * Move all SERVICE tiles currently in the market to the
Service Tile Reserve space.
 * Refill the market as needed. If any additional SERVICE tiles
are drawn, they are moved to the reserve and additional tiles
are drawn to fill the market.
 * For the remainder of the game, all SERVICE tiles drawn are moved to the
reserve and replacement tiles are drawn to fill the market.
 * Players may review the tiles in the reserve at any time and make purchases
from there. Players may make multiple purchases from the reserve on a
builders holiday.

Prestige Rating 1 (PR1) Tile Reserve: After the 2nd courtship is concluded, the
PRI Tile Reserve activates, and the following steps are then taken:
 * Move all tiles with a PRI in the market io the PRI Tile Reserve space.
 * Refill the market as needed. If any additional PRI tiles are drawn, they are
moved to the reserve and replacement tiles are drawn.
 * For the remainder of the game, any PRI tiles drawn are moved to the
reserve and replacement tiles are drawn.
 * Players may review the tiles in either reserve at any time and make
purchases from there. Players may make multiple purchases from both
reserves on a builders holiday.

Special Actions

Special Actions (SA) refer to a class of actions where a player may trade reputation
for pounds, refreshed servants, or new choices in the Builders Market. Each player
board lists these actions (see Glossary page 21). The three SA are:
 * Borrow Pounds (£): Anytime during a player's turn, she may borrow an
unlimited amount of money as long as reputation is available. The cost of this
action is a decrease in reputation by 2 per £100 borrowed.
 * Service Help: Anytime during a player's turn, he may refresh as many
servants as desired as long as reputation is available. The cost of this action is
a decrease in reputation by 3 per servant refreshed.
 * Refresh Builders' Market: Anytime during a player's turn, she may refresh
the Builders' Market only once as long as reputation is available. The cost of
this action is a decrease in reputation by 4 when the market is refreshed.

How to Refresh the Market: The tiles in the market are removed and set
aside (tiles in the SERVICE or PRI reserve are never affected by a market
refresh action). Six new tiles are drawn and placed in the market in Tile
Sorting Number order; duplicate tiles are stacked, and the reserve is used if
in effect (see Builders Market Reserve above). The tiles that were removed
from the market and set aside are then added back to the bag. The market is
refreshed.




Courtship and Passing

8. Clear Player Board: Move servants who participated in the activity to the
Expended Service box on the player board. Return the improvement tile just
 used to the country estate organiser. If it is the 1st time the activity has been
hosted, flip it over to the side showing the rose in the upper right-hand corner. If it has
already been flipped, do NOT flip it again (tiles used in activities are only flipped once,
except for hybrid tiles). Place gentry who attended the activity into the discard pile,
face-up. The players turn is over, and the next player in clockwise order takes his turn
(turn order is clockwise, but the 1st player marker is passed counterclockwise after
each season, which happens three times per game).

Passing

If a player chooses io Pass, Step 2 of a Standard Turn (see page 8)
still applies he is impacted by any special events showing on the
Round Track (as described on page 6, right side), he still collects
any monument reputation, and he still may use a Servants' Hall Gf
he has one). In addition, passing accomplishes the following:
 * The player takes hack his Discard Pile, creating an Active Hand consisting of
all his Gentry cards. All gentry are again available to attend activities.
 * The player refreshes service, placing all servants in the Available Service box
on his Player Board.
 * Next, the player chooses between two options:
 1) Collecting £200 in tenant rents, taking £200 from the supply, or
 2) Declining the £200 in tenant rents in favour of refreshing the Builders
Market (see Special Actions, previous page, for refreshing instructions).
 * The player then has the option of purchasing from the Builders Market. It is
an unwise strategy to refresh the market without a reserve of pounds to spend;
such an action only benefits the next player in the turn order.

Courtship

The arrival of Charles and Elizabeth Fairchild both eligible, refined, and substantial-
ly wealthy into a relatively modest corner of Derbyshire engages the minds, hearts,
and conversation of every member of the social elite within a day s ride by carriage.

Players represent families emerging from an extended period of economic hardship
with a goal of rehabilitating their standing. A most effective way to improve family
fortunes is to secure a connection (via marriage) with a reputable, wealthy family. In
Obsession, Charles and Elizabeth Fairchild represent the best of connections and are
the focus of the game's seasonal Courtship event.

In Standard Play, a courtship event takes place on Round Track spaces 4, 8, 12, and
16. In Extended Play, courtship events occur on round track spaces 5S, 10, 15, and 20
(the reverse side). These spaces feature the word Courtship and show an
icon of a Victorian couple.

For an open courtship (which is the default courtship), a Theme Card is
revealed at the start of the season. The first three courtship events are
scored for the single theme card revealed in that season. The last
courtship event is scored for the cumulative total of all four theme cards.

The 1st Three Courtship Events
The theme card is revealed at the start of the season, showing a category of
improvement the Fairchild siblings highly value (.e, ESSENTIALS, SERVICE,
ESTATE, PRESTIGE, or SPORTING). Players then play three standard, 
activity-based rounds. At the end of that season, players total the victory points (VP) on the
Improvement Tiles in their organisers under the revealed category. In the example
below, this player nets 3 VP for
a PRESTIGE courtship (the
i0tal of the two tiles in the
prestige theme category).

The player with the highest total
gets a courtship visit from the
Fairchild of their choice. The
card representing the desired Fairchild is taken from
the round track and put into the winning player's
Active Hand. This player keeps the card for the next
season, inviting the Fairchild to activities as desired, normal guest rules applying.

Note: In standard play, the first action on courtship rounds 8, 12, and 16 is for the
player who won the previous courtship io locate the Fairchild card in their Active
Hand or Discard Pile and return Charles or Elizabeth to the round track area. This
does not apply during the first courtship (round 4) because, being the first courtship,
no player is yet holding a Fairchild card. It also does not apply if a previous courtship
was a tie (discussed below) because no one holds a Fairchild card.
The winner also takes one Victory Point Card from the round track, &
examines the favour, and sets the card, face down, near the player board. A 393
victory point card offers players a choice between the number of VP
indicated on the card (3, 4, or 5) and a benefit that players may take at any time
during their turn (f they surrender the VP). To the right is a card that offers the player
a choice between 4 VP or 3 reputation. The player does not have io make that choice
when acquiring the card; at any time during her turn right up until end game scoring
begins, she may take the favour by revealing the card and surrendering the VP.

Courtship Tie: If there is a tie between players in the theme category, each player
takes a VP card, but the Fairchild suitor does not spend the next season with any of
the contenders, the love interest cannot decide which family to visit!

The Final Courtship Event

On round 16 in standard play (round 20 in extended
play), players total the VP on the improvement tiles in
their organisers under ALL revealed categories. If a theme appears twice, the VP in
that column are counted twice, reflecting the love interest's consuming passion for the
lifestyle associated with that doubled improvement type. For example, the courtship
combo seen above would reflect a love of the outdoors, gardens, animals, and riding,
attended by a fine staff of footmen formal picnic in the French Garden might be a
favourite activity. This courtship would be very different from one that featured two
Essentials, one Prestige, and one Service theme. That courtship would reflect a love of
libraries and an appreciation for formal dining, galleries, and other indoor activities.
The player with the highest total puts a Fairchild card of her choice into her card deck
for end game scoring. The winner also takes one VP card from the round track. Note:
If the card has a favour, the player may use it before final scoring if she chooses.

Tiebreakers: If there is a tie among players in the total for all four theme categories,
the player with the highest player board reputation wins the final courtship. If still
tied, no one wins the card of either Charles or Elizabeth Fairchild, but all tied
players draw a WP card.




Solitaire

The central gameplay mechanic of Obsession is the hosting of events, which is an
action that takes place independent of one's competitors. As a result, Obsession
naturally lends itself to solo play.

Setup

Pages 3, 4, and 5 of this Rulebook describe setup. For Solitaire, observe the following
small differences:
 * Starting Player: The Solitaire Player (SP) is always the starting player.
 * Player Board Selection: The SP may choose any family board.
 * Remaining Player Area Setup: The procedures for acquiring family
cards, servants, Starter Guests, and Objective Cards, as well as for
setting up the reputation wheel and Country Estate Organiser, are
identical to page 3 of the Rulebook.
 * Round Track and Supply Board Setup: Set up for a two-player game.
 * Closed courtship is used (see Jane Austen variant, Glossary page 25).

Choose an Opponent

Obsession comes with twelve opponents for Solitaire:
four expert, four intermediate, and four beginner. Locate
the Solitaire opponent cards, which are packaged with the
gentry deck when Obsession is unboxed for the first time.
Each card has the name and icon of the opponent, the difficulty, the opponents base
score in large black print, and a chart showing the development of their country estate
over time, which is used to determine Courtship winners. The SP chooses an
opponent from amongst these twelve cards and places it next to her player board.

Locate the 20-sided dice and the Solitaire card that contains the Builders Market AI,
which provides for the competitive purchase of Improvement Tiles from the market,
with Monument, being aggressively targeted. Place the Solitaire AI card and dice
next to the opponent card.

Playing the Game

The game is set up and the opponent chosen, it is time to play! Follow normal
gameplay as described on pages 8-13 of the Rulebook, which is divided into eight
steps. Once the SP ends her turn by shopping in the Builders' Market and clearing her
board, she rolls the d20 dice 1o see if the opponent - will scavenge a tile (remove a tile
from the market).

Note the positions of the Builders' Market spaces (in yellow) as
it relates to the solo AI these positions will be referenced every AI turn.

Builders' Market Reserve Note: Even though the management of the Builders
Market has changed from the 1st printing of Obsession to the 2nd printing, solo play
can be played with either market system. Early playtesting with the market reserves
(see page 12) reveals that service courtships are easier to win and objectives are easier
to complete (helping the solo player), but that the scavenging action, which ignores
the reserves, is more consequential (stealing tiles of greater value on average).
New Market Solo Rule: If the AI scavenges a duplicate tile, both tiles are removed
from the game.

If no monument is on display in the market, use the Standard Turn column on the A
card.

After the dice is rolled, remove the tile from the appropriate position 
(or not at all, if a 16-19 is rolled; refresh
the market if a 20 is rolled). The tile is removed from the
game. Next, slide the tiles to the left and add a new tile
drawn from the tile bag to the right-most position.

If a monument is on display, use the Monument Turn column on the AI card. (If there
is more than one monument, the AI targets the least expensive one.)

If a 16-19 is rolled (no purchase), subtract 5 from the dice value on the next turn
(there cannot be two consecutive no purchase' dice rolls). If a 20 is rolled and the
market is refreshed, the opponent does not make a purchase and will have iis dice roll
modified next round (from dice value next turn). Move the round track marker.
ahead one space and begin the next round.

Courtship

When the round track marker is advanced to a courtship space, a theme card is
revealed. Courtship proceeds normally as described on page 13 of the Rulebook,
except that the SP compares her WP total for the revealed theme to the appropriate
theme value on the opponent's card chart. For example (playing against Eden, seen on
left), if PRESTIGE is the theme revealed in Season 2, the SP compares her PRESTIGE
total to the value 3, which is Eden's PRESTIGE total in Season 2. If the SP
wins, she secures the VP card and Fairchild card per normal. If she loses, the top vP
card is placed face-down (no looking) next to the Solitaire opponents card. Those
points will be added to the base score in large black print on the Solitaire opponent's
card during end game scoring. If the courtship is a tie, both the SP and the opponent
receive a VP card.

For the final courtship, the opponent, if it wins, not only secures a VP card but the
Fairchild card as well (all to be used in end game scoring).

End Game Scoring

After the final courtship event, the SP totals her VP normally using the scorepad. This
total is compared to the total of the opponents large black base score on the card and
any VP cards won during courtship, as well as the 8 VP for the Fairchild card, if
applicable. High score wins! The Solitaire player wins all ties.

Rule Exceptions
 * Butlers Room: The SP can only hire servants; they cannot recruit.
 * Servants Hall: The SP action is to simply increase reputation by
one (no action impacts the opponent), much as with a Monument.
 * Gentry Cards: If gentry cards have an attack element (gossip), no
attack takes place; such cards are simply treated as undesirable
guests (with negative VP counting during end game scoring, unless
the guest is dismissed).

Challenging Mode - Monuments Variant: For an extreme upgrade in the AI
challenge, add the VPs for all monuments scavenged by the AI to the base score, in
addition to courtship VP cards and Fairchild card VP if any.




End Game Scoring

End Game Scoring

After the last Courtship event, the round track pawn is
moved to the centre space with the wedding bells icon;
it is time to see who wins the overall competition and
the game! For end game scoring, use the included
scorepad to total the victory points for the seven
categories described below.

1. Improvement Tile VP
Total all VP showing on each improvement tile (lower right-hand corner) in your
organiser, monuments included.

EXAMPLE: In
the country
estate organiser
to the right, the
player finished
the game with
thirteen
Improvement
Tiles.

He adds together
the white
numbers
in the lower
right-hand
corner of each
tile for a total
of 24 VP.

2. Gentry Card VP

Total VP in the upper right-hand corner of all the cards in your gentry deck,
positive and negative.

EXAMPLE. The cards below represent scoring cards from a player's Gentry deck
(positive and negative VP) other than his family members. This player had a large
deck, but most Casual Guests do not grant victory points. The player adds the 8 VP
for his family (this total is the same for all families except the Asquiths; the dowager
countess adds an additional VP for a total of 9) to the VP values for the five guests
below for a total of 21 VP.

3. Objective Card VP

Total the VP for each completed objective.

EXAMPLE: This player finished with 3
Objective Cards. He reached maximum
reputation (as indicated by the circular Max
tile with the British flag on his player board). He also succeeded in purchasing both
the North Library and the Conservatory, achieving a difficult group objective. He did
not finish the game with three lady's maids. This player earned 19 victory points for
completing two of his three objectives.

4. Reputation VP

Calculate the VP for reputation showing on the player
board.
EXAMPLE: The VP earned for reputation is the total of the
numbers representing each level achieved added together.
This is a triangular number sequence; the next level is
always worth one more VP than the previous, making the
highest level worth the most (standard play and extended
play VP charts to the right).

5. Service VP

Award 2 VP per servant present on the player hoard,
regardless of type (butlers, underbutlers, and housekeepers
are worth the same 2 VP as valets, lady's maids, and
footmen).

6. Wealth VP

Award 1 VP for every £200 remaining on the player
hoard, rounding down. Extra coins have no VP value.
For example, £500 rounds down to £400 for 2 VP; the extra £100 is not counted.

7. Courtship VP

Expose and total the Courtship/Victory Point cards.
EXAMPLE: This player won two courtships, chose not to
trade the VP for either favour, and therefore adds 9
victory points to his total.

Calculate the GRAND TOTAL and announce the winner.

TIEBREAKERS. If there is a tie, the player with the Fairchild card in his gentry
deck is the winner. If tied players do not have the Fairchild card, the highest Player
Board reputation wins. If it is still a tie, players share the victory. Critical Note: Total
VP wins; a player does not need the Fairchild card in hand to win the game.

What Is an Activity?

Obsession's engine is the hosting of social activities,
and while all the trappings of such gatherings need t0
be thematically sound (history, titles, location, people,
etc.), the favours that flow from these activities are
what powers the game along. If theme is queen in
Obsession, then favours must make thematic sense.

To begin, when you host a social activity (i.e., a game
of bowls on the Bowling Green), that is the focal point
of a visit usually spanning several days. Travelling
around the countryside in 1860s England was neither
quick nor entirely comfortable, and guests from some
distance away would enjoy an extended stay.
Furthermore, the family is always present, regardless
of whether any family members were featured at the
activity itself.

It is important io realise that the activity is not
concurrent with the favours. It is in gameplay, but not
in the real world of our setting. You are hosting two,
maybe three, social events at your country estate per
season, a time which spans many months.

A visit is planned, provisions purchased, and the estate
made ready, then guests arrive and enjoy some notable
activity. Conversations begun on the Bowling Green
carry over to the Drawing Room and the dinner table.
After a stay of several days, your guests slowly depart
at their convenience.

No pounds change hands, no new connections have yet
been made, no local attitudes about your family have
evolved, for no one is yet aware. Get out of the
house' dismissals, while perhaps possible, are highly
improbable. There was a visit of some days with
certain activities standing out (ie., the one you hosted)
that slowly sends out ripples through local society.
During the weeks following the visit, the consequences
of your foray into high society come io fruition:
 * At the market, our housekeeper proudly mentions
the name of a distinguished visitor from London to
Lady York's maid, who carries the news back to her
viscountess.
 * Lady Cavendish learns that the older sister of her
dear friend who had visited will be in town, and she
immediately pens an invitation to both ladies for a
game of Cassino in the Parlour
 * The earl's instructions io his banker based upon a
whispered word from a well-connected parliamentarian
about international tensions permits the earl
to protect a foreign investment.

Thus are favours born.

Thematic Background of Favours

Let's examine the three main favours more closely.

Peter, Viscount Townshend
(£300): A guest who grants a
financial favour usually has
flavour text describing
extensive travels or connections
in political society
(where government laws and
favouritism will likely benefit
the aristocracy).

Viscount Townshend, an
expert in horseflesh, visits Earl
Asquith Io see his now horses. The viscount stays only
a short while due to pressing matters in London and
departs on day three after a morning ride to hounds.
During this visit, the earl learns that the tea crop in
India was poor and, several days later, his banker
makes a move in tea futures.

Major Anthony Cole and the
Hon. Albert Plantagenet
(both 3 reputation): A guest
who grants a reputation favour
either has a high prestige
rating, reputable connections,
or an element of impressive
personal history that reflects
well on the hosting family,
perhaps an admired military
man who is respected every-
where, a woman who is
accomplished, or a man with a noble lineage.
The Asquiths enjoy an
afternoon in the Drawing
Room with the Hon. Albert
Plantagenet and Major
Anthony Cole. The family has
a strong military tradition, and
Major Cole's heroism on the
Continent is of great interest.
And all know the story of the
Plantageneis (and, if you do
not, Albert will tell you).

Later that week, after the guests have departed,
servants running errands in town describe in glowing
terms the proper and impressive guests. It gets back 10
the valet for Viscount Ponsonby, who discusses (with a
bit of envy) the visitors with his friends. Word spreads.
People, some graciously, some enviously, acknowledge
that the Asquiths are doing rather well.

Hon. Regina Washburn (1
reputation, prestige invite): A
guest who grants an invitation
favour usually has flavour text
describing social connections.
After visiting the Asquith estate
and spending time in their new
English Garden, Regina
Washbum returns home and
raves to her mother about the
exquisite glory of the Countess's
floxgloves; Viscountess Hampton (her mother)
suggests Regina take her
friend, Lady Suffolk, to see
them as she is a lover of
flowers of all types. Tne
following month at a Ball,
Regina connects with Lady
Suffolk, and they agree she
simply must see the garden.
Regina sends a note to Lady
Asquith the following day. A
new connection is made.
In the game of Obsession, you embrace the gentle pace
of 19th-century English life. The improving of your
country estate, courtship of the Fairchilds, and
rehabilitation of your family's reputation unfold
gradually, thematically, historically.
