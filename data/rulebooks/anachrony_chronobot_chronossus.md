## CHRONOBOT RULES

> The Chronobot was sent back from a devastated alternate future with the objective of finding and eliminating the cause of a war that destroyed everything. Though created with the best intentions, it has identified humanity as the real problem—the root of the destruction to come. Misinterpreting its original task, the Chronobot is now determined to take over the leadership of all humankind, even if it has to destroy the Paths, or the Capital itself, to achieve its goal.

The Chronobot is one of two solo play opponents for Anachrony, playable with the base game only. In these rules, “you” will refer to the lone human player, while “Chronobot” or “it” will refer to your opponent.

**NOTE:** If you’ve played the original Chronobot included in the first few printings of the Anachrony Base Box, please refer to the Appendix for Summary of Changes.

### CHANGES IN SETUP

Set up a 2-player game, with the Chronobot as one of the players. Use the Chronobot side of the Solo board. In addition to using the Chronobot’s side of the Solo board, the following changes need to be made during setup:

1. The Chronobot receives its 6 Exosuits and 8 Warp tiles; it does not receive any Starting Assets or Workers.
2. Leave all Endgame Condition cards in the box.
3. Place the Chronobot board next to the Main board, and place the 4 Command tokens on the 4 marked positions.
The Chronobot does not use a Focus marker.
4. Place the Chronobot’s Banner on the First Player spot; it is the First Player in the 1st Era. You receive 1 additional
Water (for being the second player).
5. You may still choose to use either the “A” or the “B” side of your Player board.
6. For a more challenging game, use the variant rule described in the base game rulebook: cover the right World Council space with a Hex Unavailable tile.

### 2 PARADOX PHASE

The Chronobot rolls for Paradoxes last. If the Chronobot gains an Anomaly, it stops rolling (like you would), then removes any one Warp tile from the Timeline tile where it has the most Warp tiles (oldest if tied). If it would gain an Anomaly when it already has 3 Anomalies, it does not receive another one, nor does it remove a Warp tile.

### 3 POWER UP PHASE

**In pre-Impact Eras, the Chronobot always powers up 6 Exosuits, while in post-Impact Eras, it powers up 4**. The Chronobot neither gains nor spends Energy Cores or Water. Powered-up Exosuit markers are piled on top of each other on the upper right Hex-shaped slot.

### 4 WARP PHASE

Warping occurs in player order. For the Chronobot’s Warp, roll the Paradox die. Place Warp tiles for the Chronobot equal to the rolled number of Paradoxes. The Chronobot does not gain anything for its Warp tiles, and it does not matter which warp tile it places. You choose 0-2 Warp tiles to place as normal.

### 5 ACTION ROUNDS PHASE

On the Chronobot’s turn, roll the AI die. The Chronobot
performs the Action shown above or below the token
with that number, then advances the token to the
next position. If there are already two tokens there,
move the top one to the next position prior to moving
the active token.

#### GENERAL RULES OF THE CHRONOBOT’S ACTIONS:

* The Chronobot does not use Workers to take Main board Actions, only empty Exosuits.
* It ignores everything printed on Action spaces or Collapsing Capital tiles and never pays the costs of Actions. It cannot place on face-down Collapsing Capital tiles.
* It always picks the topmost available space on Capital Actions.
* If there are no available spaces on a Capital Action the Chronobot rolled, it places on a World Council Action space instead, always taking the First Player spot if possible.

#### FAILED ACTIONS

If an Action cannot be taken because there are no available Action spaces, it does not place an Exosuit and receives 1 VP instead. If an Action can be taken but cannot be performed (examples are given in each Action’s section), the Chronobot places the Exosuit and receives the 1 VP instead of the normal effect of the Action.

#### CONSTRUCT

Each of the Chronobot’s Construct Actions is for a specific building type (or Superproject). When using the Construct Action, the Chronobot always picks the building with the higher VP value. If tied, it takes the one in the secondary stack. If it already has 3 buildings of the desired type, it takes nothing (but it still places an Exosuit to block a Construct Action space, and takes 1 VP, as usual, for Failed Actions).

When Constructing a Superproject, the Chronobot first discards a Breakthrough (of any shape or icon; if it has multiples, it discards one of whichever it has the most of—choose one randomly if tied). Then, it takes the highestVP, face-up Superproject from the Present or any past Era (oldest if tied).

If “Construct Superproject” is rolled and the Chronobot does not have a Breakthrough to discard or it already has 3 Superprojects, it does nothing (but it still places an Exosuit to block a Construct Action space and takes the 1 VP as usual for Failed Actions).

#### RECRUIT

When taking the Recruit Action, the Chronobot takes a Worker type it does not yet have, following the priority order below. If this Worker type is unavailable, it takes an available type, following the priority order. It does not receive its respective Recruit bonus; however, it receives 1 VP regardless of the Worker type.

**Genius > Administrator > Engineer > Scientist**

Once it has at least one of all 4 Worker types, it discards one of each and gains 5 VPs.

#### RESEARCH

When using the Research Action, only roll the shape die, taking any Breakthrough of the rolled shape.

#### RECRUIT GENIUS/RESEARCH

When using the Recruit Genius/Research Action, perform a Recruit Action (see previous page) only if a Genius is available, taking it along with 1 VP (even the Chronobot already has a Genius). If no Genius is available, perform a Research Action instead (see above).

#### MINE RESOURCE

When taking the Mine Resource Action, the Chronobot determines which 2 Resources it wants the most.

* It prioritizes Resources it does not have.
* If tied, it chooses based on the following priority:  
**Neutronium > Uranium > Gold > Titanium**

Then, it takes the Mine Resource Action space from which these 2 Resources can be gained. If multiple possibilities are available, it selects the topmost one.

Once it has at least one of all 4 Resource types, it discards one of each and gains 5 VPs.

#### TIME TRAVEL

When “Time Travel” is selected, it removes any one Warp tile from the past Timeline tile where the Chronobot has the most Warp tiles (oldest if tied). If a Warp tile was removed the Chronobot advances one step on the Time Travel track.

The Chronobot does not place any Exosuits on a Time Travel Action. If there are no Warp tiles left on the Timeline, the Action is failed, and it scores 1 VP as usual.

#### REMOVE ANOMALY

Each time “Remove Anomaly” is selected, it discards any 2 Resource cubes. Choose Resources it has the most of; if tied, the order of priority is:

**Titanium > Gold > Uranium > Neutronium**

1 Neutronium cube is equal to 2 non-Neutronium cubes when calculating priority and discarding. Then, if it has the Resources to discard, it removes 1 Anomaly. If it doesn’t have an Anomaly or the Resources to remove one, it takes 1 VP instead as usual for Failed Actions.

#### REBOOT

Each time “Reboot” is selected, the Chronobot simply does nothing. This does not count as a Failed Action, and it does not receive 1 VP.

#### EVACUATION

The Chronobot never takes the Evacuation Action.

#### PASSING AND END OF ACTIONS

Once the Chronobot has run out of Exosuits, it takes a Time Travel Action on its next turn (if able), then passes. However, if you pass first, and the Chronobot has taken at least 3 Actions, the Action Rounds Phase ends immediately. If the Chronobot has not yet taken 3 Actions, it will continue taking turns until it has, at which point the Action Rounds Phase would end.

**NOTE:** The Chronobot will never take fewer than 3 Actions.

### 6 CLEAN UP PHASE

Retrieve the Chronobot’s Exosuits along with your own, as normal. After the Impact, follow the usual procedure for flipping Collapsing Capital tiles.

### END OF GAME

The Chronobot does not lose VPs for its Warp tiles that remain on the Timeline. It scores 1 VP per Breakthrough, plus 2 additional VPs for each complete shape set.

**If you have more points than the Chronobot, you win; otherwise, you lose.**

### INCREASING THE DIFFICULTY

Select one or more of these options to increase the difficulty of the solo game against the Chronobot:

* Immediately advance the token when it moves onto the Reboot Action. This will ensure that it will perform an Action on every turn.
* Play without using your Leader power.
* The Chronobot takes one additional turn after you have passed.
* Increase the minimum number of Chronobot’s Actions from 3 to 6.

**NOTE:** You can use an unused Path’s Exosuits to track the number of Actions the Chronobot takes, especially if you decide to raise the number of Actions to 6.
