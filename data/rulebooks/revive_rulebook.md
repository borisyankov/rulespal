### GENERAL SETUP

1. Place the **game board** in the middle of the table.
2. Shuffle the 5 **starting area tiles** and place them *face up* on the indicated spaces in the middle of the **game board**. Shuffle the remaining 25 **area tiles** and place them *face down* on the other spaces.
3. Shuffle the 5 **large location tiles** and place one tile with a random side facing up on each of the 4 corner spaces of the **game board**. Return the unused location tile to the game box.
4. Shuffle the **citizen cards** and put them in a facedown deck. Reveal 5 cards and put them face up next to the deck.
5. Sort the **machine tokens** by color and put them in three piles next to the **game board**. Flip 3 tokens from *each* pile face up.
6. Shuffle the **slot module tokens** (from now on called **slot modules**) and place them in a facedown pile. Reveal 5 tokens and place them face up next to the pile.

   The faceup citizen cards, machine tokens and slot modules are referred to as the **display**.

7. Shuffle the **crate tokens** (from now on called **crates**) and place them in a facedown stack next to the **game board**.
8. Place the **energy markers** (from now on called **energy**) in a supply next to the **game board**.
9. Put the **action cubes** near the game board.
10. Make a stack of the **minor artifacts** and put the end game tile on top.

    > **In a solo game:** Do not use the **end game tile**. Return it to the game box.

11. Place the **major artifacts** face up on the crater area on the game board. Use only artifacts marked with your number of players on the back side (e.g. with 3 players, use artifacts marked «1+», «2+» and «3+»). Return amy unused major artifacts to the game box.

*Variant: For a longer game, use artifacts as if you were one extra player (e.g. include artifacts marked «4» in a 3 player game). To play a long game with 4 players, put 2 minor artifacts next to the craters (the game ends when all 12 major artifacts and these two minor artifacts have been taken).*

### PLAYER SETUP

*Use a quantum randomizer to pick a starting player. If you do not have such a device available to you, determine the starting player in any way you feel provides an acceptable level of randomness.*

Each player takes the following:

1. One **player board**. Place it in front of you.

2. One random **tribe board**. Place it with the **sun** side facing up to the left of your player board (the **moon** sides will be unlocked in the campaign!).

   *If all players are familiar with the different tribes, players may choose their tribe boards in a counter-clockwise order, starting with the player seated to the right of the starting player.*

3. 1 grey, 1 green, and 1 yellow **machine track marker**. Place them on space 1 of each of their respective **machine tracks**.

4. 1 **energy token** from the supply. Place it in your **energy storage**.

5. **1 switch token**. Place it in the indicated slot on your player board (shown below) and slide it up (to the unused position).

6. A random set of 6 **starting citizen cards** (marked with an S on the back). All your cards should have the same letter (A, B, C, or D) on the front.

   Shuffle your 6 cards and place 3 of them *face down* to the right of your **player board** (your **resting area**). Place the remaining 3 cards *face up* below your **tribe board** (your **active area**).

7. 1 random **artifact card**. Keep your artifact card secret from the other players. Return the unused artifact cards to the game box.

   *If all players are familiar with the game, give each player 2 artifact cards instead. Look at your two cards and choose one to keep. Return the other card to the game box.*

8. 1 **player aid card**.

#### Each player chooses a player color and takes the following in their color:

9. 5 **small buildings** and 3 **large buildings**. Place the buildings on the dedicated spaces on your tribe board.

10. 7 **population figures**. Place one on each population icon on your tribe board.

11. 2 **pawns**. Place one as a **point marker** on space **0** of
the **point track**, and 1 as a **hibernation marker** on the
lowest space of the **hibernation track**.

#### Ultimately, each player takes the following components:

12. 20 **progress markers**: Place one on each of the 15 **reward spaces** along the machine tracks. Also, place one on each of the 5 spaces at the bottom of your tribe board.

13. 4 **resource markers**. Place one on the bottom space of each of the **resource tracks** on your **player board**.

#### STARTING RESOURCES:

The starting player advances their leftmost marker one space (they begin the game with 1 **crystal**). The second player advances their two leftmost markers one space (1 **crystal** + 1 **gear**). The third player advances their three leftmost markers (**crystal** + **gear** + **book**), while the 4th player advances all four of their resource markers one space.

> **In a solo game:**  
Begin with 1 crystal as your starting resource.  
Place 1 **action cube** on the first space of the progress track (bottom left corner of your player board). Return the other **action cube** to the game box.

All unused player components are returned to the box.

## HOW TO PLAY

### THE GOAL OF THE GAME

*Each player leads a tribe, trying to rebuild the world according to their own ideals. You will explore new lands, build buildings, and populate the various locations. Certain actions let you collect an artifact. The game ends when the last major artifact has been taken from the game board. You then score points from several sources, including your collected artifacts, your artifact card, your researched technologies, your progress track and your populated locations. The player with the most points wins.*

### IMPORTANT GAME CONCEPTS

#### RESOURCES:

There are 3 basic resources in the game: **Gear**, **Book**, and **Food**. Whenever you gain a resource of a certain type, advance your corresponding **resource marker**. Whenever you use a resource, move the corresponding marker down. If you gain a resource when you are on the top space, the extra resource is lost.

**Crystals** may be transformed to any other basic resource at *any time* during the game. If you gain a crystal while at the top space on the crystal track, you may therefore advance one of the other resource tracks instead. Some actions will specifically require that you pay with a crystal.

Certain effects provide discounts. Discounts cannot reduce a cost below 0.

#### BLUE POINTS vs. PURPLE POINTS:

**Blue points** are scored *during the game*. When you gain blue points, advance on the **point track**. If you reach or pass a bonus space on the point track, you immediately receive the shown reward (gain a **crate** or **artifact**).

**Purple points** are only tallied at the *end of the game*. When purple points are tallied, you also advance your point marker, but you do *not* gain rewards from bonus spaces along the point track.

***Note:** If you exceed 50 points, continue counting from the start of the track. You do not gain rewards for passing bonus spaces a second time.*

#### PROGRESS MARKERS AND PROGRESS TRACK:

Each time you activate your **tribe ability** or unlock a **reward space** along the **machine tracks** on your player board, you move a **progress marker** to the lowest vacant space on the **progress track**. Placing a **progress marker** in certain spaces provides a bonus, such as taking **energy** from the supply, or an **artifact** from the **game board**. At the end of the game, you score the points visible in the lowest vacant space on your **progress track**.

> **In a solo game:** You also have an **action cube** on your progress track. This cube is only used to track your card actions, and it does not interfere with progress markers on the track (i.e. place markers and move the cube independently of each other).

#### RANGE:

When taking various actions on the game board, you need to pay for **range**.

### ABOUT THE GAME

*The campaign consists of 5 parts. During the campaign you will unlock additional contents for the game. We recommend you start the campaign right away, but if you prefer, you may also just play the game with the basic rules.*

To start the first chapter of the campaign, read the top card of the **campaign deck**. The campaign deck will guide you through the 5 chapters, one by one. You do not need to play the entire campaign with the same players.

After you have completed the 5 chapters, you may continue to play using all unlocked elements, or only the ones you prefer.

### HOW TO PLAY

The starting player takes the first turn.

On your turn, you either  
**Perform up to 2 actions** OR **Hibernate**

Players keep taking turns in clockwise order until someone takes the last **major artifact** from the game board. All other players then take one last turn before the game ends. The player with the most points wins.

If you choose to perform up to 2 actions, the following actions are available:

* Play a card
* Use your **switch token** (if available)
* Explore
* Populate
* Build

Important notes:

* You may perform two different actions or the same action twice.
* If you cannot or do not want to take at least 1 action, you must hibernate.
* In addition to taking actions or hibernating, you may always perform any number of free actions on
your turn: **Trade crystals** to other resources, **Activate machines** and **Open crates**.

#### Use of the action cubes in a 2-4 player game:

When you perform an action, you (or another player) may place an **action cube** on the corresponding space on a **player aid card**. This keeps track of which actions you have taken and makes it easier for other players to see when you have finished your turn. This may be helpful later in the game, when actions become more complex.

#### Important notes:

* You may perform two different actions or the same action twice.
* If you cannot or do not want to take at least 1 action, you must hibernate.
* In addition to taking actions or hibernating, you may always perform any number of free actions on your turn: **Trade crystals** to other resources, **Activate machines** and **Open crates**.

> **In a solo game:** You have a total of 20 card actions before the game ends. *Always take 1 action per turn.* Whenever you choose the action "Play a card", move the **action cube** *1 space* up on the progress track.
>
> When you choose the action "Hibernate", move the **action cube** *2 spaces*. Do not advance the action cube when taking other actions.

## ACTIONS

### PLAY A CARD

Take one of the cards from your **active area** and tuck it into a *vacant* **card slot**.

If you play the card in one of the two top slots, gain the effect shown on the top part of your card.

If you play the card in one of the two lower slots, gain the effect shown on the lower part of your card.

***Note:** You may not play cards in the slot on the right side of your player board until you have unlocked its corresponding technology (see [Populate](#populate)).*

#### SLOT MODULES

Whenever you play a card in a slot, *check all modules in that slot:* Each module is activated if it shows the color of the played card (all modules show 1 or 2 card colors).

When you gain a slot module, place it on a module space on your player board. If you place the module in a space with activation symbol you immediately activate the module and gain its effect.

You are allowed to discard modules at any time to make space for a new module (replacing a module on an activation symbol does not activate the new module).

#### SLOT SYMBOL

Some cards have a **slot symbol** at its top or bottom edge. This symbol allows you to play another card in this slot later.

When you do, all cards in this slot matching the new card’s color are reactivated.

#### EFFECTS ON THE STARTING CARDS

Using an effect is always optional!

**Resource** - Gain the shown resource.

**Trade** - You may trade a basic resource (gear, book,
food) for any other basic resource
You may repeat this up to 3 times, choosing
the same or a different resource each time.

**Slot** - Take a slot module from the display. Place it in a vacant module space on your player board and replenish the display.

**Colored arrow** - Advance 1 space on the machine track of the indicated color.

**Star** - Activate your **tribe ability** (shown below the character portrait on your **tribe board**). Whenever you activate your tribe ability, also move one **progress marker** from your tribe board to the lowest vacant space on your progress track.

If you cannot carry out the ability (for example, if you cannot pay its cost), you do not get to move a progress marker. Note that you may still use your tribe ability after you have removed all progress markers (but you will not gain the benefit of moving another marker).

**Slot / Star** - Gain a slot module OR activate your tribe ability.

### USE YOUR SWITCH TOKEN

Slide your **switch token** down (to the “used” position). Gain any one basic resource (not a crystal).

This action may not be used again until your switch token has been moved up to the “unused” position (usually when you hibernate).

The effect of the switch token might seem simple, but it may not remain that way throughout the campaign...

### EXPLORE

Choose a facedown **area tile** on the **game board**. Pay the cost for **range** (as described below) and the cost shown on the back of the chosen tile. You must be able to reach the tile; you cannot pass through other unexplored area tiles.

Gain the points shown on the back of the chosen **area tile** (advance your **point marker** accordingly).

Then recruit a new citizen: Take any one of the faceup **citizen cards** from the display or the top card from the **citizen deck**. Place the recruited card face up in your **active area** and refill the display with a new card from the deck if needed.

Flip over the chosen **area tile** and place it face up in its space. Rotate the tile as you wish (each tile may be placed in one of two orientations).

**Important**: If any spaces on the tile you just flipped are adjacent to buildings owned by any player, the owning player now gains the rewards from these spaces (see **[BUILD](#build)**).

#### RANGE

When you perform the actions explore, build or populate,
you must pay for **range**. At the beginning of the game, range
is counted from the **chasm** in the middle of the **game board**.
Once you have placed a piece (**building** or **population figure**)
on the **game board**, range is counted from your nearest piece
(and never again from the chasm).

Count the spaces to where you want to perform the action
and pay 1 **food** for each space between you and your target
(i.e. only count each space you go through, not the origin or
destination spaces).

**Note:** When you perform an action adjacent to one of your own pieces, there are zero spaces between you and your target, so there is no cost for range.

**Important:** You may count range through occupied spaces, but never through unexplored area tiles.

### POPULATE

Choose a **location space** on the **game board** that you have not already populated. The location may have been populated by other players.

Choose a **population figure** from your tribe board and place it on the chosen location. You must pay the cost for **range** and the cost for the action itself:

The cost for the action is the number of books shown on the **technology** where the population figure is taken from. In addition, you must pay **1 book to each other player who already has a population figure on this location**.

The first time you populate, you must use the population figure from the bottommost technology on your tribe board. This unlocks the technology, giving you access to a unique ability for the remainder of the game.

In future population actions you may only unlock technologies that are connected to an already unlocked technology.

The **large locations** in the corners are populated in the same way as the regular locations. Each **large location** count as one large space. If you populate a large location, you also gain the points shown, at the end of the game.

***Note:** Each location (both regular and large) may be populated by more than one player, but never more than once by the same player.*

***Note:** Some card and machine effects may provide a discount to the populate action cost. This discount only affects the cost for the technology. You must still pay 1 book to each other player who has a population figure in the location.*

#### COMMON TECHNOLOGIES: (common to all tribes)

Unlock your fifth card slot (on the right side of your player board). When you play a card in this slot, you may rotate it to play it either for its top effect or its bottom effect.

Take any 1 major artifact from the board  
AND  
Gain 1 energy marker from the supply  
Gain 1 crate from the supply  
Gain 1 crate from the supply

### BUILD

Choose a vacant **sand space** where you want to build. Pay for the **range** to this space and the cost for the building you want to place (3 gears for a **small building** or 5 gears for a **large building**).

Then check for the following rewards:

* If your building is adjacent to one or more **terrain spaces** (forest/ mountain/field), advance the corresponding **machine track marker(s)** on your player board one space for each terrain space.
* If your building is adjacent to a **crystal** (along the edges of the board), you gain a crystal resource.
* If your building is adjacent to a new **water** space (meaning that you do not already have a building adjacent to this water space), take the reward shown. *Note that several players may gain the reward from the same water space, but each player can only gain the reward from each water space once.*

**Large buildings:** Large buildings *double the rewards* from **terrain spaces** and **crystals** (i.e. they advance your track markers 2 spaces per terrain, or provide 2 crystals per crystal symbol), but they only provide a normal, single reward from water spaces.

Important notes:

* Buildings can only be built on **sand**.
* There can never be more than 1 building on each space.
* If any player explores an area tile so that a new terrain or water space ends up adjacent to one of your existing buildings, you immediately gain the reward from that new space. *If this causes several players to unlock reward spaces on their machine tracks, players take their rewards in player order, beginning with the current active player.*

#### ADVANCING ON THE TRACKS

Each **reward space** along the tracks is unlocked once you reach or pass certain values on the track with 1 or 2 markers. When you unlock a reward, remove the **progress marker** from the space and place it on the lowest vacant space on your **progress track** (along the left side of your player board).

**Important:** Some reward spaces require that you have reached or passed the space with 2 different markers.

If you reach the end of a track, further advances on this track will instead provide 1 resource of the type shown.

#### REWARD SPACES

**Standard machine:** Once unlocked, you may activate it by using energy.

**Special machine:** When unlocked, immediately take a **special machine** of the matching color from the supply and place it in the vacant spot. You may activate this machine by using **energy**. Reveal another machine tile so that there are 3 **special machines** of each color in the display.

***Note:** If you unlock more than one special machine on your turn, replenish the display between each of your picks.*

**Artifact:** Immediately take any one major artifact from the **game board** and place it next to your **artifact card**. *They are worth points at the end of the game.*

**End game card bonus:** At the end of the game, you score 2 points for each card you have recruited of the color shown (starting cards do not count!).

### HIBERNATE

Instead of performing up to 2 actions, you may **hibernate**. If you cannot or do not want to perform 1 or 2 actions on your turn, you *must* hibernate.

When hibernating, perform the steps below:

1. Return all **energy** from your machines to your **energy storage**. *You may use them again on future turns.*
2. Take all cards from your **resting area** and place them *face up* in your **active area**. *If you have unplayed cards remaining in your active area, they remain in place.*
3. Take all played cards from your **card slots** and place them *face down* in your **resting area**.
4. Slide your **switch token** up to the «unused» position.
5. Advance your **hibernation marker** one space. Gain the reward shown to the right of your **current space or any space below** on the **hibernation track**.

When you move to the 4th space on the **hibernation track**, you must immediately also remove one **major artifact** of your choice from the **game board**. This **artifact** is removed from play *(return it to the game box)*. If this was the *last* **major artifact**, you gain the **end game tile** and trigger the end game.

***Important:** When you hibernate, you may spend any remaining energy to activate machines at the **beginning** of that turn. However, once you move energy markers back to your energy storage, you cannot activate more machines that turn.*

***Note:** You are allowed to hibernate even if your marker is on the last space of the hibernation track. In this case you do not move your marker and may choose any one of the rewards on the right side of the hibernation track.*

> **In a solo game:** When you hibernate, you may choose to discard any number of **citizen cards**, **machine tokens** and/or slot modules from the **display** (remove discarded components from the game). Then replenish the display.
>
> Remember to advance the **action cube** *2 spaces* along your progress track when you hibernate.

#### FREE ACTION: TRADE

At any time during your turn, you may convert **crystals** to other basic resources (gears/books/food). For some tribes, unlocking certain technologies give access to additional trade options.

### FREE ACTION: USE A MACHINE

At any time during your turn, you may use **energy** to activate any of your unlocked machines to gain its immediate effect. Move an **energy** from your **energy storage** to the machine you want to activate. This machine may not be activated again until the energy has been removed (usually when you hibernate).

***Notes:** You may use any number of machines on your turn. Some tribes have a machine on their tribe board. Once unlocked (by a populate action), these machines work like any other machine.*

#### STANDARD MACHINES: (three standard machines are printed on your player board)

Convert any 1 basic resource to a crystal.

Take a card that you have played in a slot and move it to your resting area. This not only frees up a slot; you also get this card back to your active area sooner (the next time you hibernate).

Use this machine when you perform an action to temporarily increase your **range** by 1 (meaning you pay 1 **food** less for range for this one action).

### FREE ACTION: OPEN A CRATE

When you collect a **crate**, place it face down (closed side facing up) above your **tribe board**. You may look at your closed crates at any time.

At any time during your turn, you may open a closed crate and
gain its immediate effect. Keep your opened crates next to your
player board until the game ends. Some effects let you score
points for having collected crates.

***Note:** You may open any number of crates on your turn.*

## GAME END

If a player takes the last **major artifact**, they also take the **end game tile**. When they are done with their turn, all *other* players now take one last complete turn before the game ends.

If any player is supposed to gain an artifact after the last major artifact has been taken, they instead take a **minor artifact** (worth 2 points during end game scoring). *The supply of minor artifacts is meant to be unlimited. If you run out, use any other markers as substitutes.*

Then all players tally their **purple points**. Note that during the end game scoring, players do not gain bonuses from moving along the scoring track!

Each player counts the following points and advances their scoring marker accordingly:

* The lowest visible points on their **progress track**
* Points on **unlocked technologies** on their tribe board
* Points from each large location where they have a **population figure**
* If you have unlocked the **end game card bonus** on a machine track: Gain 2 points per card of the shown color *(not including starting cards!*)
* 4 points to the player with the **end game tile**
* 2 points for each **minor artifact** *(artifacts collected after game end was triggered)*
* 1 point for each 5 **remaining resources** (rounded down)
* Points from the **artifact card** and **major artifacts**:  
   All players score points for the three categories shown on their artifact card. For each major artifact they have collected, they score the category matching the artifact’s color once more.

**The player with the most points wins the game.  
Ties are broken in favor of the player with the most remaining unscored resources. If the tie persists, the tie is broken in favor of the player who has advanced furthest on their three machine tracks combined. If this is tied as well, the tied players share the victory.**

> **In a solo game:** The game does not end when you take the last major artifact. If you gain additional artifacts, keep taking minor artifacts. The game ends when the action cube moves beyond the top space on your progress track. Compare your score with the table below. *You may find it harder to gain high scores with certain tribes, as not all technologies are as useful in a solo game. This is part of the challenge: See what ranking you can achieve with all the different tribes.*

| | |
|-|-|
| 49 or less: | You lose |
| 50+: | Survivor |
| 75+: | Minor victory |
| 100+: | Regular victory |
| 130+: | Major victory |
| 160+: | Superior victory |
| 180+: | Utopia |

### SCORING OF ARTIFACT CARDS

**Remember:** Always score all three categories on your artifact card once. Then score each category once more for each major artifact of the indicated color that you have collected.

* Each **crate** (count both used and unused crates)
* Each **energy marker**
* Every 2 **slot modules** (rounded down)
* Each **population marker** you have placed *(both small and large locations)*
* Each progress marker removed from your tribe board
(each conducted tribe ability)
* Each **flask symbol** on your machines, slot modules, and cards (including those in your resting area)
* Each card (count all cards in active area, card slots and resting **area**, but do not count starting cards!)
* Each unique **water space** that you have collected a reward from (built next to)
* Each unique **crystal symbol** adjacent to one of your buildings.  
Each crystal is only scored once, even if you have several buildings next to that crystal. Vast crystals also count *(unlocked in the campaign)*

### SCORING OF LARGE LOCATIONS

* Score points equal to the number shown in the space where you have your green/yellow/gray **machine track marker**
* Each **energy marker**
* Each **slot module**
* Each **large building** you have built
* Each **population marker** you have placed (both small and large locations)
* Each **population marker** you have placed in a **large location** (including this)
* Each **card** (count all cards in active area, card slots and resting area, but do *not* count starting cards!)
* Each unique **water space** that you have collected a reward from (built next to)

### UNLOCKED IN CAMPAIGN

* Each **progress marker** removed from your tribe board *(each conducted tribe ability)*
* Each unique **crystal symbol** adjacent to one of your buildings. Each crystal is only scored once, even if you have several buildings next to that crystal. *Vast crystals also count (unlocked in the campaign)*
* Each **flask symbol** on your machines, slot modules, and cards (including those in your resting area)
* Each **crate** (count both used and unused crates)
* Count the number of unique **area tiles** (incl. **starting area tiles**) where you have a **building** or a **population figure** present. Large location tiles do not count! Gain 3/7/12/15 points for having presence on at least 3/6/8/10 tiles.
* When you populate this location, immediately gain 1 energy marker from the supply. At game end, score 1 point for each flask symbol you have (including cards in your resting area).

## REFERENCE

### NÀDAIR

#### SUN

* You gain 1 extra book and 1 point whenever you perform your tribe ability.

* When counting range, do not pay for any forest or water spaces you move through.

#### MOON

Begin the game with **5 forest tiles**

Tribe ability: Pay 1 crystal to place a forest tile on any vacant desert space. You must pay for the range to this space (from your nearest building or population marker). Owners of buildings adjacent to the new forest tile advance on their green machine tracks as normal.

After having placed the tile, you gain 1 book for this tile and for all other forest tiles connected to this tile in an unbroken chain of forest tiles.

### HOFSTADTERIANS

#### SUN

* Tribe ability: Gain 1 basic resource for each unique water space you have built next to.

* You may at any time convert any 2 basic resources to 1 crystal.

* You do not pay extra books when populating a location that has been populated by other players. This includes the location that unlocks this technology.

#### MOON

Begin the game with **5 temple tiles**

Tribe ability: Pay 1 crystal to place a temple tile on any vacant water space. You must pay for the range to this space. Immediately collect the reward from this water space even if you have already claimed it with a building.

*When counting range for any actions, you may count range from your temples.*

By using temples, it is possible for you to collect the reward from each water space twice (once if building next to the water, and once if placing a temple tile there). Each water space still only counts once for scoring. Placing a temple on a water space does not block other players (or yourself) from claiming the water’s reward with a building.

When counting range from a temple, increase your range by 2 (i.e. pay 2 less food).

### ]0X49[

#### SUN

* When ever you perform the explore action, you pay 1 food less.

* This is a machine that can be activated by using **energy**. Activate when performing an explore action to gain unlimited range for that action. You may use this to explore any area tile on the board (even those lying beyond other unexplored area tiles).

* Unlocking this technology has an immediate one-time effect: Move one of your population figures from one regular location to any other regular location (not a large location) where you do not already have a population figure *(you do not need to pay books to players present there)*.

#### MOON

Begin the game with **5 target tiles**

Tribe ability: Place a target on any **sand space** or **location** where you do not have a building or population figure *(you may place it anywhere, as you do not need to pay for range)*.

If you later perform an action on this space (building or population action), you gain a discount of 2 on the action cost. Then, return the target from the game board to your supply.

If another player performs an action on this space, you gain the resources they spend on the action (not including cost for range or books paid to other players when populating). Then, return the target from the game board to your supply.

### KUNIBAN

#### SUN

* Tribe ability: Pay 1 food to take any card from the display and place it in your active area.

* Whenever you gain a new card from the display, you also gain 1 resource, depending on the color of the card.

* At any time, you may pay 1 crystal to move a played card from any of your card slots to your resting area.

* This is a machine that can be activated by using **energy**. Activate it to move one unplayed card from your active area to your resting area. Gain the top effect of the card.

#### MOON

Begin the game with **5 sand tiles**

Tribe ability: Place a **sand tile** on any *vacant* **terrain space** (field, forest or mountain). You must pay for the range to this space. ***Note:** You cannot place it on a water space or a terrain space with any markers or figures on it.*

Then, take 1 faceup card from the display matching the terrain’s color (field = yellow, forest = green, mountain = gray) and place it in your active area. If there aren’t any matching faceup cards in the display, you do not gain a card.

If any player builds on a **sand tile**, that player immediately gains 1 point.

### FORMICA

#### SUN

* When you build, you get a discount of 1 for each mountain terrain adjacent to the building space.

* At any time, you may trade 1 crystal for 2 resources (of the same type).

* This is a machine that can be activated by using energy. Activate it to gain 1 crystal.

#### MOON

Begin the game with **5 workshop tiles**

Tribe ability: Pay a crystal to place a **workshop** on any terrain space (field, mountain or forest). You do not need to pay for the range. Immediately advance 1 space on the machine track matching the terrain type.

You gain a discount of 1 on all actions you perform adjacent to a workshop *(i.e. building costs 1 gear less, populate costs 1 book less, explore costs 1 resource less). Workshops do not provide discounts when paying for range. You can gain at most 1 discount from workshops per action (if multiple workshops are adjacent, you still only get 1 discount).*

Immediately slide your switch token to its top (unused) position.  
From now on, when you use the switch action, you may copy the *bottom* effect of a card of another player. Treat the effect as if you just played the card in your own area.

### VUKUNTUR

#### SUN

* Tribe ability: You may immediately take an explore, build or populate action (this action does not count as one of the two actions for your turn). You may skip 1 space for free when paying for range for this action.

* You may always skip 1 space for free when paying for range. Range bonuses from several sources are cumulative.

* Immediately gain 1 crate and 1 crystal.  
*From now on, you always gain a crystal whenever you gain a crate.*

#### MOON

Begin the game with the **falcon figure**. Place the falcon on the chasm space on the game board.

Tribe ability: You may always count range from the falcon *(as well as from your own buildings/figures as normal)*.

When the tribe ability is activated, move the falcon up to 3 spaces per progress marker that has been removed from the tribe board, including the one removed by the current action *(i.e. 3 spaces per visible tribe symbol)*. The falcon must end its movement on a terrain space *(forest, mountain, or field)*. Formica’s workshops do not block the falcon. The falcon may land where it started.

You gain a discount of 1 on actions performed on a space adjacent to the falcon *(i.e. building costs 1 gear less, populate costs 1 book less, explore costs 1 resource less)*.

When you activate your tribe ability, gain 3 resources, determined by the type of terrain where the falcon ends its movement.

### EFFECT OF SYMBOLS

#### SYMBOLS FOUND ON MACHINES ONLY:

**All machine effects are temporary (they only apply when the machine is activated).**

* Move one (unplayed) card from your active area to your resting area. Gain the top effect of that card.
* This machine can only be activated when you play a card. You may rotate the card 180 degrees to take the lower action (in a top slot) or the top action (in a lower slot).
* This machine can only be activated when you perform an **explore action**. Do not pay for range. You may use this to explore any area tile on the board (even those lying beyond other unexplored area tiles).
* When you activate this machine, temporarily treat any 1 card as if it has *all colors*. This could be relevant for triggering slot modules when playing a card, or for effects that let you play or count cards of a certain color. You cannot use this machine during end game scoring.
* Pay 1 gear to reactivate any 1 of your already opened crates (gain the crate’s effect again). Each crate cannot be reactivated more than once during the game. To keep track of this, move your reactivated crates to the right side of your player board.
* Use this machine when you conduct the action shown to gain a discount of 2 on the action cost (does not affect range cost).

#### SYMBOLS FOUND ON CARDS ONLY:

* Gain 1 food for every yellow card currently in your card slots (including this card).
* Gain 1 resource for all *visible* flasks in your play area (on machines, slot modules, and visible cards in your active area or card slots (including this card). **Note:** A flask symbol at the bottom of a card is not visible if the card has been played for its top effect.
* The effect shown applies while this card lies in a card slot. The effect ends when the card is moved to the resting area.
* [Slot symbol] You are allowed to play another card in this slot later. If you play a card in this slot matching the color of any previous card(s), the previous card is activated again.
* After this card has been played, perform a **Hibernate action**. This ends your turn. This card is then removed from the game (return the card to the game box).

> **In a solo game:** this hibernate action does not advance the action counter further.
