## Game principle

In Welcome To, players are American architects in the 50s during the Baby Boom. But beware of the competition! Who will best accomplish the city’s plans by creating the nicest housing estates in the three streets they’ve been assigned? Will your luxurious parks and fancy pools be enough to earn you title of Best Architect?

Welcome To is a game where everyone plays at the same time with the same cards. It’s all about cleverly combining the house numbers with their associated effects in order to become the greatest architect of tomorrow!

## Purpose of the game

Architects gradually develop their three streets by building **houses**, identified by **their numbers**.

Houses will be grouped into **housing estates**, but only fully-completed ones count at the end of the game.

**Parks** and **pools** help to improve the neighborhood.

Architects can raise the quality of their constructions in order to promote **their estates’ value**.

All of this while trying to be the first to complete the **City Plans**!

Finally, by increasing recruitment through **temp agencies**, architects can hasten the construction and get in the mayor’s good graces.

## Setup

* Each player takes a pen or pencil (not provided) and a sheet from **the player sheet**.
* Distribute the **Player Aids** to the players.
* Shuffle and randomly choose 3 **City Plan cards** from the basic set: one n°1, one n°2, and one n°3. Place them "Project" side face up so all players may see.  
Return all remaining City Plans to the box.
* Shuffle the **Construction cards**. Deal 3 equal stacks of 27 each, **house number face up**. Place these in a column with room for discards to their right.

## Game turn

At the beginning of each turn, flip over the top card of each construction stack and place it to the right with its effect displayed. These stacks create three combinations, comprised of a House Number and an Effect. These combinations are used to perform actions.

Players take turns simultaneously. Each player individually chooses one of the three combinations available to perform an action on their sheet. Multiple players can pick the same combination.

Each player must write the number from the chosen combination in a house on one of the three streets on their sheet. Numbers must always be written in an **empty house** and must be written in **ascending order** from left to right.

**The same number can never appear twice in the same street** (except for the ["Bis" effect](#bis)).

If a player cannot follow the placement rules, they do not fill in a house number and receive a **building permit refusal**. Cross off the top-most, lowest-numbered space.

The player’s chosen combination also allows them to perform an effect. Players may perform the effect only if they did not receive a building permit refusal.

**Note: performing an effect is optional.**

Once all players have built their houses and carried out effects, a new turn begins. If the construction stacks are ever empty, reshuffle them and deal out as before.

### Note

When filling in houses, players may leave as many empty houses between two built houses, and then fill them in later. Numbers must still be in ascending order.

Also, players may skip numbers when filling in houses, like placing a 10 directly after a 7.

## Effects

### Surveyor

Allows the player to build **a fence between two houses** on the same street. To build a fence, choose any available, white-dotted space and draw a line on it. Permanent fences are present on both sides of each street. Fences determine the boundaries of **housing estates**. A completed housing estate is a row of 1 to 6 neighboring houses, all numbered (no blank spaces between them) and built between two fences. Completed housing estates are necessary to fulfill **City Plans** and may be split further, as long as they have not previously fulfilled a [**City Plan**](#city-plans)).

### Real Estate Agent

Promotes and increases the value of **completed housing estates**. To use the Real Estate Agent, choose a Real Estate column and cross off the top-most, lowest numbered space. At the end of the game, each completed estate (size 2, 3, 4, etc...) scores as many points as **the smallest, unchecked number** from its corresponding column.

### Landscaper

Allows the player to build a park. The player crosses off one of the trees at the end of the street. **Parks must be crossed off on the same street that the house number is written.** Parks are crossed off, left-to-right in ascending order.

### Pool Manufacturer

Allows a player to score points when building houses that have **a planned pool**. If a player writes the house number associated with the **Pool Manufacturer effect** in a house with **a planned pool**, then the pool is built. Cross off the top-most, lowest-numbered space in their **pools column**.

**Note:** A player can use a house number/effect combination without a Pool Manufacturer effect to write a number in a house. Oppositely, a player can write a number associated with the Pool Manufacturer effect in a house without a pool. However, in both cases, the pool is not built; therefore the player does not cross off a new pool in their pools column.

### Temp Agency

Allows the player to add or subtract 1 or 2 to the house number they are building. The Temp Agency allows the player to write numbers from 0 to 17. For each use of the Temp Agency, cross off one box from the **Temp Agency column**. At the end of the game, the player who crossed off the most Temp Agency boxes scores 7 points. The next highest scores 4 points, and the third highest scores 1 point. In case of a tie, players score the same amount of points.

### «Bis»

Allows the player to duplicate a house number on any street. **The new house must be directly adjacent**, to the left or right of the house with the same number. Duplicate houses **can never be separated by fences**. When duplicating a number, write "bis" next to the number in the new house. A house can be duplicated multiple times, and the duplicated number **does not have to be associated with the number/effect combination**. Cross off the top-most, lowest-numbered space in the "bis" column. At the end of the game, subtract the smallest, unchecked number from the final score.

## City Plans

**A City Plan** presents a goal set by the City to its architects, as in building a certain number of housing estates with mandated sizes.

The first player(s) who meet the required conditions of a City Plan during the same turn immediately score the points indicated. Write **the higher amount** from the "Project" side of the City Plan card in the corresponding box (n°1, 2, or 3) in **their Plans column**. Turn over the City Plan to its "Approved" side. A player can only score each City Plan once.

Other players who later achieve the same City Plan score the lower point amount.

### Housing Estates Plans

To fulfill these City Plans, the player must complete **all of the required housing estates**.

The estates do not have to be in the same street. **There is no restriction to the location** of a Plan’s estates.

The first player who completes a goal can choose to reshuffle the 81 Construction cards and deal three new stacks of cards as in game setup.

**Note:** After an estate has fulfilled a City Plan, it cannot be further subdivided with a Surveyor’s fence. Also, it cannot fulfill another City Plan. The player marks out the fence above each house to indicate it has already fulfilled a City Plan.

## End of the game

The game ends immediately when:

* A player crosses off their **third Building Permit Refusal** or
* A player achieves all **three City Plans** or
* A player has built **all of the houses on their streets**.

Add up the points for **City Plans, parks** on each street, **pools**, **temps**, and completed **estates** Subtract the points from the **"Bis" column** and the **Building Permit Refusal** column.

The player with the most points wins!

In case of a tie, the player with the most completed estates wins. In case of another tie, the player with the most 1-house estates wins, then 2-house, etc... In case of another tie, (seriously?) players play another game of Welcome To.

## Solo game

This variant allows players to play a game of Welcome To while trying to achieve their best score.

### Setup

Shuffle the **Construction cards, effect side face up** and randomly deal out two equal stacks. Shuffle the **Solo card** into one of these two stacks, then place this stack **under the other without shuffling again**. Shuffle and randomly pick three **City Plan cards**. Place them "Project" side face up next to the Construction cards. Take a **player sheet from the pad and a player aid**.

### Game turn

At the beginning of the game, draw **3 Construction cards**. Then, choose **two of the three cards**, **one for its number**, and **one for its effect**. Discard the remaining card.

A player can always refer to the corners of the card on its number side, as it displays the effect from the reverse side of the card.

Perform actions using the two cards as you would in the multiplayer game, discarding after playing them. Begin a new round by drawing 3 new cards and repeat. When **the Solo card** is drawn, all Plans are considered "**approved**" and it is no longer possible to achieve the higher score. T**urn over the Plan cards to their "approved" side**. All other rules from the classic game remain the same.

### End of the game

The game ends when the stack of cards is empty, or one of the three end conditions of the basic version occurs.

The player counts their points as in the classic mode. Exception: in the Temp Agency, the player only earns 7 points if they hired at least six temps. Less than six and the player receives zero points.

## Advanced variant

### Additional City Plans

These goals can be added to the basic version. The same rules apply to them.

### List of objectives

To fulfill this City Plan, **all houses** must be built **on the required street**.

To fulfill this City Plan, **the first and last house of each street** must be built.

To fulfill this City Plan, **all of the parks** AND **all of the pools** on the required street must be built.

To fulfill this City Plan, **7 temps** must be hired.

To fulfill this City Plan, **two streets** must have **all of the parks** OR **all of the pools** built.

To fulfill this City Plan, the player must build **all of the parks, all of the pools,** and **one roundabout** in **the same street**.

To fulfill this City Plan, **5 duplicate houses’ numbers (bis)** must be built on **the same street**.

**Reminder:** When an estate or a house has been used for a Plan, it cannot fulfill another City Plan. The player marks out the fence above each house to indicate it has already fulfilled a City Plan. However, a pool used for a City Plan does not invalidate its corresponding house for another plan.

### Roundabout

Before or after building a house and activating an effect on their turn, a player can choose to create **one of the two available roundabouts**. Choose an empty house’s box, draw a circle and a dot inside it where a house number would go, and then build **estate fences** to the left and the right of the roundabout.

**The roundabout divides the street in two**. Therefore, **house numbers may start over directly to the right of the roundabout**. Players can use numbers 0-17 to the left of a roundabout, while also using numbers 0-17 on the other side.

Cross off the top-most space on the roundabout column. The first costs 3 points and the second costs 5 points. At the end of the game, subtract the smallest, unchecked number from the final score.

## Expert rules

This variant allows players to have more control over choosing Construction cards, while increasing the interaction between players. It is possible, and even recommended, to use the advanced variant with the expert rules.

### Setup

Shuffle **all of the Construction cards**, **effect side face up**, into a single deck. Shuffle and draw **three City Plan cards** and place them Project side face up next to the Construction cards deck. Randomly give a player the **Solo card**. Each player takes a player sheet from the pad.

### Game turn

On the first turn, all players draw **three cards** from the Construction cards deck. From those cards, players choose **two of the three cards**: **one for its number and another for its action**. Players cannot use the same card for its effect and number.

Then, players place the cards in front of them and use them per the basic rules (the house number of one and the optional effect of the other). Discard the cards after play.

Next, each player passes their remaining card, **effect side face up**, to the player on their right. Finally, a player deals **two Construction cards** to each player for the next turn, beginning with the architect who has the **Solo card**.

The other rules of the basic version apply.
