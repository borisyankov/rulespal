## Game Overview

*Arkham Horror: The Card Game* is a cooperative Living Card Game® (LCG®) in which one to four investigators work together to unravel arcane mysteries and conspiracies, while simultaneously overcoming the personal demons that haunt their past.

Each player takes on the role of a single investigator and builds a deck around that investigator’s abilities. A series of interrelated scenarios creates a narrative campaign through which a broader mystery is unraveled. In each of these scenarios, the investigators move through and explore a number of menacing locations, look for clues that enable them to advance the story, and attempt to evade or defeat the treacherous forces of the Mythos.

As progress is made in the campaign, each investigator gains experience and insight, which allows them to develop in a variety of ways by adding powerful new high-level cards to their deck. But beware: As one’s exposure to the arcane world increases, so too does the risk of insanity. The investigators must protect themselves against this tightening grip of madness, all the while attempting to survive and solve the mystery.

### A Living Card Game

*Arkham Horror: The Card Game* is a one-to-four-player cooperative game. One to four players can play using just the contents of this core set. In addition, *Arkham Horror: The Card Game* is a Living Card Game® (LCG®), and the experience of the game can be customized and enhanced through the purchase of regularly released expansions. Expansions may introduce new investigators, additional scenarios or campaigns, and new player cards that add variety and depth to investigator decks. While playing through an entire campaign creates the best experience, each scenario in a campaign may instead be played as a standalone adventure. Unlike collectible card games, all LCG expansions have a fixed distribution; there is no randomization to their contents.
