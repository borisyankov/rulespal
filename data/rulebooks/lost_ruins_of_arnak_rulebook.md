Thematically, your archaeologists are in the tents and your resource tokens are in the supply crates, but you can organize this space however you want.

### Research Tokens

Your research tokens go on a starting space below the research track. The first time you research, you will use your magnifying glass, so place it atop the notebook.

### Your Starting Deck

Each player has their own deck, and all decks start the same. Your deck should have the 4 basic cards in your color, plus 2 Fear cards:

* 2 Funding cards
* 2 Fear cards
* 2 Exploration cards

Shuffle your deck and place it face down on your player board.

### Play Order

The starting player is the one who most recently traveled to a place they had never visited before. Give this player the **starting player marker**. Play will proceed clockwise.

### Starting Resources

Starting resources depend on play order, as shown.

**Player 1:** 2 coins

**Player 2:** 1 coin, 1 compass

**Player 3:** 2 coins, 1 compass

**Player 4:** 1 coin, 2 compasses

## Gameplay

### Goal of the Game

Your task is to lead an expedition to explore the uncharted island of Arnak and discover the secrets of a vanished civilization.

You will equip your expedition with useful items, search the jungles for mysterious artifacts and intriguing archaeological sites, struggle to overcome the guardians of those sites, and – perhaps most importantly – piece together the fragments of Arnak’s ruins into a coherent body of research that could lead to the discovery of the Lost Temple.

Your expedition’s various accomplishments are worth points which will be added up at the end of the game to determine which player has led the most successful expedition.

### Game Overview

The game is played over 5 rounds.

Players take turns choosing various actions that help them uncover the secrets
of the island. Over the course of the game, more of the island will be explored
and more actions will become available. Actions can earn you resources,
opportunities, and points.

Each round proceeds as follows:

1. **Draw.** All players draw from their decks until they have a hand of **5 cards**.
2. **Take turns.** The player with the starting player marker starts. Players take turns clockwise around the table. You are limited to **one main action** on your turn, plus an **unlimited number of free actions**.
3. **Pass.** On your turn, you may pass to indicate you are done playing for the remainder of the round. The other players continue taking turns until all players have passed.
4. **Set up for the next round.** All cards in your play area are shuffled and returned to the **bottom of your deck**. The board is set up for the next round. **The starting player marker is passed to the left.**
5. **Move the moon staff.** At the end of each round, move the moon staff to mark the passage of time. As the moon waxes, the expeditions explore the island, acquire useful items and artifacts, and research the legends of Arnak. After 5 rounds, the moon is full and it is time to see who led the most successful expedition.

### Resources

* **Coins** represent funding for your expedition. They are used to buy items.
* **Compasses** represent time and energy spent exploring the island. Thus, they are used to discover artifacts and new archaeological sites.
* **Tablets** represent ancient texts you can decipher. These texts might teach you how to use the artifacts you find.
* **Arrowheads** represent remnants of weapons you discover. They are often necessary for overcoming the guardians of the island.
* **Jewels** are mysterious talismans of the bird god Ara-Anu. They are hard to find, but often essential for completing your research into the mysteries of Arnak.

## Your Turn

On your turn, you have several options. Your choices will depend on the cards in your hand and the situation on the game board.

### Main Actions

Choose one of these actions as the main action for your turn:

* Dig at a Site (page 9)
* Discover a New Site (page 10)
* Overcome a Guardian (page 11)
* Buy a Card (page 12)
* Play a Card (page 13)
* Research (page 14)
* Pass (page 17)

You always perform exactly **one main action** per turn.
You may also be able to perform **one or more free actions**,
as explained below.

### Your Hand

You can play a card either for its travel value or its effect but not both.

#### Travel Value

You can use this travel value to pay for certain actions – like the **Dig at a Site** action on the facing page.

or

#### Effect

You can play the card for its effect.

#### Free Actions

An effect with this icon does not count as the main action of your turn.

On your turn, you can play as many free actions as you like. They can be played **before, after, and even during your main action**.

#### Fear

A Fear card has no effect. However, it can be used for its travel value.

#### Your Play Area

When you use a card, it goes face up on the table in front of you, next to your player board. This space is called your play area.

Your play area is basically a spread-out discard pile. Cards accumulate from turn to turn. They are not recycled into your deck until the end of the round.

## Dig at a Site

As your main action for your turn, you can send one of your archaeologists to dig at any of the 5 TODO sites. You will also be able to dig at I and II sites after they have been discovered.

### To Dig at a Site

1. **Pay the travel cost** depicted on the space to which you want to send your archaeologist. The space must be unoccupied. (That is, it must have no archaeologist figure on it, and in a 2- or 3-player game, it must have no blocking tile.)
2. **Move your archaeologist** from your player board to that space.
3. **Resolve the effect** depicted at the site. (A full key of icons is on the back page of this rulebook.)

Note: If both your archaeologists are already on sites, you cannot take this action.

Example: Red spends a  card with a  to send her archaeologist to the site
illustrated here. She places her figure on the space and takes two tokens.
The next player to use the site this round will need to cover a cost of . Even
Red could do this, on a later turn, despite having one archaeologist already there.
If both spaces are occupied, no one else can be sent to dig there this round.
