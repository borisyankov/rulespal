# Keyflower Rulebook

## Table of Contents

## Game summary

Keyflower is a game for two to six players played over four rounds. Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a 'home' tile and an initial random team of eight blue, red and yellow workers. Same coloured workers are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills, additional workers and victory points not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.

In spring, summer and autumn more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In winter players will choose the village tiles for auction, each of which will offer victory points for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers.

Keyflower will present players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles which appear in that particular game. Throughout the game players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilise their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers.

## Set up

Place the **blue, red and yellow workers** in the cloth bag.

Place the **green workers** together at the side of the playing surface.

Sort the **resource counters** into the four different types to create a general supply at the side of the playing surface.

Place the **skill tiles** face down into a pile at the side of the playing surface.

Each player receives a **player screen**. These should be carefully constructed using the separate chimneys pieces to lock the walls and roofs into place.

Each player draws eight **workers** at random secretly from the bag, so that the colours of the workers are not disclosed to the other players, and places these workers behind their screen.

Sort the large **hexagonal tiles** by type: home (6), boat (6), turn order (4), spring (12), summer (12), autumn (12) and winter (12). (There are sufficient bags to store each type separately.)

Each player receives a **home tile** at random. The home tile is placed in front of the player's screen and in reach of the other players.

The player who received the lowest numbered home tile takes the **purple start player worker**.

The number of **boat tiles** used in the game depends on the number of players. Each boat tile is marked on the initial face up side to indicate in which games it is used. The number of boat tiles used is equal to the number of players. Place the relevant boat tiles in a row at the edge of the playing surface, with the side indicating the number of players face up, and the orientation facing the centre of the playing surface. (Players should take the opportunity to acquaint themselves with the scoring opportunities shown on the reverse of the tiles which will be available for auction in winter.) Place a number of **workers** from the bag and a number of **skill tiles**, both as indicated on the boat tile, next to or on top of each of the boat tiles.

The number and side of the **turn order tiles** used in the game also depends on the number of players. Each of the tiles is marked to indicate whether it is used and which side is used. Place the turn order tiles in a row next to the boat tiles, but closer to the centre of the playing surface, with the side marked for the number of players in the game face up and the orientation facing the centre of the playing surface.

Place a number of **spring tiles** in the centre of the playing surface as indicated in the table below. Place the side with the spring icon face up. Place the tiles so that they are at the same angle as the boat and turn order tiles and so that each player can identify with one side of the tiles.

Depending on the number of players, each player receives two or three face- down **winter tiles** as indicated in the table below. Players may look at the reverse side of the tiles, but should not show these to the other players.

Any surplus home, boat, turn order, spring and winter tiles are placed back in the box and are not used in the game.

Place the twelve **summer tiles** and twelve **autumn tiles** in two separate piles. These will be used later in the game.

The number of large hexagonal tiles used in the game are as follows:

| Players | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Home    | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| Boat    | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| Turn order | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 4 |
| Spring, summer and autumn | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
| Winter per player | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 |
| Winter introduced | 2-6 | 3-9 | 4-12 | 5-10 | 6-12 |

## Start of season

After the set up phase, players are ready to start the game. The player who received the **lowest numbered home tile** starts the game in **spring** and takes the **purple start player worker**.

In **summer**, **autumn** and **winter** the start player for that season is the player who won the bidding for the **highest numbered start player tile** (depicting the start player worker) in the previous season.

In **summer**, **autumn** and **winter** turn the **boat tiles** over where appropriate so that the icon representing that season is visible.

In **summer** and **autumn** place a number of new workers (from the bag) and skill tiles onto the boat tiles as indicated on the tiles. In the unlikely scenario that there are insufficient workers in the bag, fill boats in order with one worker at a time, but not with more workers than are stated on the tile. No new workers or skill tiles are placed in the boats in **winter**.

In **summer** and **autumn** place a number of **village tiles** for that season in the centre of the playing surface as indicated in the table on page 2. Place the side with the season's icon face up. Note that the four summer boat tiles, if selected, have a summer icon on both sides. The face up side of these tiles is chosen at random. (The summer boat tiles cannot be turned over or upgraded.) Any surplus tiles are placed back in the box and are not used in the game.

In **winter** each player selects one or more of the winter tiles that they received in the set up phase. (Placing the tiles 'in the fist' is the method suggested for performing this action.) The numbers of tiles selected are then revealed simultaneously and placed, still face down, in a pile in the centre of the playing surface. The tiles are then shuffled (if there are more than two players), still face down, and then turned over and laid out in the same way as the earlier season tiles, but so that players do not know which tiles were selected by which player. Place any tiles not played in the box.

**On their turn** a player places one or more workers into *a single location* in order to either:

1. **bid** for a village tile or turn order tile* (see 'bidding'), or
2. **utilise** a village tile (see 'production and 'transport and upgrading').

* Note that the boat tiles are not bid for with the workers directly, but the contents of the boats are chosen in the order that players successfully bid for the turn order tiles.

In each season play proceeds clockwise until all players have passed in succession. Therefore a player who has passed may take further actions as long as all the other players did not also pass.

## Bidding

### Village tiles

In order to incorporate village tiles into their village a player must win an auction for those tiles by bidding more workers than the other player(s).

1. A player chooses which village tile or a turn order tile they want to bid for and then places one or more workers *on their side* of the tile. The workers are taken from behind the player's screen or from a losing bid elsewhere. *A player cannot remove workers if they are winning a bid.*
2. All workers used in bidding for a tile must be of the same colour as any other workers surrounding the tile (as part of a bid) or on the tile (which have been placed to use that tile)
3. If the tile has already been bid for by another player then the bid must be with a greater number of workers than the previous bid. There is no maximum number of workers that can be used when bidding.
4. A player's turn may consist of adding more workers to a winning bid.
5. If workers are outbid, they can be moved elsewhere *but must remain together*. When moving outbid workers, a player may supplement these workers with other losing workers or with workers from behind their screen. Workers cannot be moved back behind a player's screen.

### Turn order tiles

Players may also place workers on their side of the turn order tiles in order to bid for those tiles. These tiles are not added to the player's village except at the end of winter. Instead the turn order tiles determine the order that the players will choose to take the workers and skill tiles from the boats and also determine the start player for the following season.

A player can bid on more than one turn order tile but they only get the workers and skill tiles from one boat. In **winter** they will receive each of the turn order tiles that they successfully bid for.

## Production

A player may acquire resources, skills, additional workers and victory points by placing workers on the tiles in their own village, in other players' villages and (except in winter) on the current season's tiles being bid for.

If a tile is being used for the first time in a season then a player usually places one* worker onto the tile.

If the tile is a tile from the current season and is therefore also being bid for, then the worker placed on the tile must be the same colour as any worker that has already been used to bid for the tile, if applicable.

A player may usually use a tile that has already been used by placing *two* workers of the *same* colour as the worker previously placed on the tile. A player may usually use a tile for a third time by placing *three* workers of the *same* colour as the workers previously placed. No more than six workers may be placed on a tile in one season.

When a player uses the tile they immediately receive the benefit indicated on the tile.

1. Any resources generated in a *player's own village* are placed on the tile generating the resources.
2. Any resources generated in *another player's village* or from a tile being bid for are placed on the player's home tile.
3. Any skill tiles generated are taken from the face down pile and placed behind the player's screen.
4. Any 'white' workers generated are taken randomly from the bag and placed behind the player's screen.
5. Any green workers generated are taken from the supply and placed behind the player's screen.

A player may use more workers than are required, for example if they are reallocating workers from a losing bid which cannot be split or to prevent other players from using a tile. Each use of a tile requires at least one more worker than the previous use. Therefore if the initial usage is with 2 workers, not 1 worker, then the next usage will cost a minimum of three workers, a total of 5 workers. In this instance the tile cannot be used for a third time in that season as the maximum number of workers allowed on a tile in one season is 6. If the initial usage is 3 or more workers, then no further use can be made of the tile that season.

In the unlikely scenario that there are insufficient resources, workers or skill tiles of the type being generated, then the player only receives the number that is available. In the case of workers, players are permitted to feel the contents of the bag to determine how many workers remain in the bag before they bid for a tile. The number of remaining green workers, resources and skill tiles can be seen by players before they bid. A player may not search in the bag for green workers if the visible supply is exhausted.

## Transport and upgrading

The village tiles (except the summer boat and winter tiles) may be upgraded by flipping the tiles over to their reverse side. The contents of the box on the reverse side can be seen in the lower smaller box of the front side.

The cost of the upgrade is shown in the upgrade box (an arrow in between the upper and lower boxes).

The player's home tiles and the transport tiles: farrier, stable and wainwright each enable the transport of resources and the upgrade of tiles. In order to upgrade a tile a player places a worker on one of the transport tiles (or two or three workers if the transport tile has already been used in this season). The player may then move up to the *number of resources* indicated on the transport tile and may upgrade one or two village tiles in their own village as indicated by the *upgrade icons*.

The transportation of resources must be along roads. The number of resources indicated on the transport tile can be split between one or more resources. For example if the transport capacity is two, then two resources can be moved along one road to an adjacent tile(s) or...

Resources required for the upgrade must be on the village tile when the upgrade is performed. The resources used are placed back in the general supplies.

Skill tokens required for the upgrade are taken from behind the player's screen and placed face down in the general supply.

Any resources not required for the upgrade and workers (if the village tile has already been used) remain in place on the tile once it has been upgraded (flipped over). When flipped, the orientation of the village tile should be the same as it was before the upgrade.

## End of season

The season ends when all players pass in succession. The following then occurs:

### 1. Unsuccessful bids

All players collect workers that they played and which form part of an unsuccessful bid and puts these back behind their screen.

### 2. Village tiles not bid for

Any village tiles that were not bid for are removed and placed in the game box. Any workers (including green workers) on those tiles are placed in the bag.

### 3. Collect village tiles successfully bid for

Starting with the start player (to avoid confusion) and then in clockwise order, each player:

a. Takes any village tile they successfully bid for and any workers placed on them.

b. Places the workers used in the successful bids into the bag (including green workers).

### 4. Collect home village workers

Any workers used on tiles in the player's home village are retained and placed behind the player's screen. (Note workers placed behind the player's screen in winter are available to the player for game end scoring purposes.)

### 5. Turn order tiles

#### a. Spring, summer and autumn:

i. The player who won the number 1 turn order tile takes the workers and skill tile(s) from the boat of their choice. The workers and skill tile(s) are placed behind the player's screen.

ii. The player(s) who won the number two, three and four turn order tiles (if applicable) then do the same, followed in clockwise order from the new start player by any of the players who did not win a turn order tile. If no player bid for the new start player tile, the existing start player remains the start player for the purposes of collecting the boat contents A player may only take contents of one boat even if they win the bids for more than one turn order tile.

iii. Usually a player will have successfully bid for the turn order tile showing the purple start player. When that tile is resolved the start player will change to that player immediately. That player takes the purple start player marker.

iv. If no player bid for the turn order tile with the start player icon then, after all of the players have taken their workers and skill tile(s), the player to the start player's left becomes the new start player and takes the purple start player marker.

v. Place the workers used in the bids for the turn order tiles into the bag (including green workers).

#### b. Winter

i. There are no new workers or skill tiles arriving on the boats.

ii. The player who won the bid for the number 1 turn order tile takes that tile and a boat tile of their choice. The player(s) who won the bids for the number two, three and four turn order tiles (if applicable) then do the same. If a player wins more than one turn order tile then they take these turn order tiles but do not take a second boat tile.

iii. Then in clockwise order from the new start player, any player who did not win a turn order tile selects a boat from those that remain. In the unusual circumstances that no player bid for the new start player tile in winter, the existing start player remains the start player for the purposes of selecting the boat tiles and then the start player marker passes to the player on the start player's left.

iv. The turn order tiles and boat tiles are added to the players' villages.

### 6. Expanding the villages

Players simultaneously add the village tiles, and in winter also the 'turn order' and 'boat' tiles, to their village.

The sides of any tiles that are placed adjacent to each other: road and water, must match. Note that the home tiles each have five without boats each have three roads, the 4 summer boat tiles have no roads, the 12 autumn tiles each have two roads and the 12 winter tiles each have one road.

In the 3 to 6 player games it is recommended that players do not place tiles with roads so as to prevent tiles being placed next to the water side of their home tile, as this would prevent them scoring a bonus from the Sea Breese boat tile in the event that they acquire this. Note that boat tiles (including the four summer boats) do not have to be placed so that the water sides connect.

Note that resources may only be transported along roads or, if obtained from outside the player's own village, direct to the home tile. So players should those tiles which require resources in order for them to be upgraded resource production tiles where feasible.

Once positioned, tiles cannot be repositioned

## Game end scoring

The game ends at the end of winter.

Players now score points for the tiles in their village and for their gold counters.

Only resources that have been placed on the autumn **barn**, **blacksmith**, **stone yard** and **timber yard** tiles during the course of the game may be kept on those tiles for scoring purposes. (Note that gold can be used as a substitute for the other resources on the barn, blacksmith, stone yard and timber yard tiles if it has been transported to those tiles during the game. However if gold is used on these tiles the gold does not also score one point for being gold as each item can only be scored once.) Resources remaining in the barn, blacksmith, stone yard and timber yard cannot also be counted for the other resource scoring tiles the jeweller, mercer's guild, watermill and windmill.

All other resources, skills and workers can be allocated as required to the other scoring tiles. No transport is required. Each item can only be scored once and can only be allocated to one bonus tile. For example a worker cannot be allocated to both the apothecary and the craftsman's guild and a resource cannot be allocated to both the watermill and the windmill.

For all of the scoring tiles except the Keythedral, the
game end bonuses may be scored multiple times if the
player has sufficient resources, skills or workers.

For scoring purposes, the **purple start player marker** may be declared by the player who successfully bid for it as a resource, skill or worker of any colour and, if applicable, placed on the **barn**, **blacksmith**, **stone yard** or **timber yard**.

**Gold** counters are worth one point each if they have not been allocated to any of the scoring tiles. For example, if a gold counter is allocated to the jeweller for two points it does not score an additional one point.

The player with the most points is **the winner**. If players have an equal number of points the players are tied and should play again in order to determine the winner.

## Village tiles - detail

When referring to 'place a worker onto the tile', this refers
to the first use of the tile. Subsequent uses will require
more workers as explained in the 'production' section.

### Turn order tiles

There are four turn order tiles. Depending on the number of players, some of these tiles may not be in use during the game. The side of the tile used will also depend on the number of players. The black worker icons at the top of the tiles indicate in which games the tile is used and which side of the tile is visible. The tiles are laid out as indicated in the set-up.

The number in the box indicates in which order the players will select the contents of the boats in spring summer and autumn and in which order they will select a boat to place into their village at the end of winter.

The purple worker icon indicates who the start player will be in the following season: summer, autumn or winter and the player who wins the bidding for that tile takes the start player marker. At the end of winter the player winning the tile depicting the purple start player worker also takes the purple start player worker.

In the winter it is possible for a player to win more than one of the turn order tiles and these are placed into their village. In the game end scoring the owner of each tile gets 1 point for each other tile that the turn order tile is connected to. Note that unless the player also owns summer boat 2a, all the sides must match: roads, no roads, water. However a player does not have to connect the boat(s) to the water side of their home tile if they do not wish to. The advantage in their doing so arises only if they own the Sea Breese boat tile.

### Boats

Each player will receive one boat at the end of winter. Each boat will give victory points as detailed below:

#### Keyflower (2+ players)

1 point for each of the player's transport capacity. (This total can be doubled if the player also owns the summer boat 2b.)

#### Sea Bastion (2+)

1 point for each tile which is connected by roads as part of a loop which connects back to the starting point without the traveler having to travel along the same route twice.

#### Sea Breese (3+)

Points as indicated for each boat (including the summer boats) that connects by river to the home tile. Notes: 1. Players should avoid placing tiles with roads which may prevent boat tiles being connected to the home tile (unless they have boat 2a). (See diagram on page 8.) 2. Boat tiles do not have to be placed so that the water sides are connected, but will not score points for the Sea Breese if they are not.

#### Flipper (4+)

The player may flip one tile in their home village without having to pay the upgrade cost. In addition they score 2 points.

#### Ianvincible (5+). 5 points.

#### White Wind (6)

1 point for each worker the player has at the end of the game. These will be workers that have been used in the player's own village in winter and workers that the player did not use in winter. Note that each worker can only be scored once. If the worker is already being scored by the apothecary, craftsman's guild, Key market or village hall, it cannot also be scored by the White Wind.

### Summer boats

The summer boat tiles have a season icon on both sides so either side can be the face up side for the game. The side is chosen at random when the summer tiles are introduced. The tile is never upgraded or flipped over. When in a player's village the tile gives that player a unique ability. The player does not need to place a worker on the tile in order to have the ability, indeed no workers may be placed on the summer boat tiles. The abilities conveyed by the boats cannot be acquired by other players.

#### Boat 1a

When taking workers from the boats at the end of summer and autumn, the player takes two additional workers from the bag if available. When taking a boat tile at the end of winter, the player takes two workers from the bag. Note these are the only new workers that any player will receive at the end of winter. The workers are drawn from the bag after all of the workers (including green workers) used in winning bids in that round have been placed in the bag.

#### Boat 1b

When taking workers from the boats at the end of summer and autumn, the player additionally takes one green worker from the supply if available. When taking a boat tile at the end of winter, the player also takes one green worker from the supply if available. Note this is the only new worker that any player will receive at the end of winter.

#### Boat 2a

When transporting resources the resources may be transported across fields (where there are no roads) as well as along roads. In addition, when placing village tiles in their village a player does not need to match the sides (roads, no roads and water). This ability does not affect the Sea Bastion boat which requires roads to be connected in a loop in order to score points.

#### Boat 2b

All of a players transport capacity and upgrade ability is doubled. If a player has the Keyflower boat at the end of the game, the Keyflower scoring is doubled.

#### Boat 3a

When upgrading any type of resource: gold, iron, stone and wood can be used in substitution for any other type of resource.

#### Boat 3b

For game end scoring purposes, gold, iron, stone and wood can be counted in substitution for any other type of resource.

#### Boat 4a

If another player has bid for a village tile using blue, red or yellow (but not green) workers, then the owner of this boat may counter bid using a different colour (including green). However all of the workers used in the counter bid must be of the same colour. When breaking the same colour rule in this way, the workers are placed lying horizontal for ease of identification.

If all of the other players' workers (the players who had been bid against) are moved elsewhere because they have been outbid and there are no workers using the tile being bid for, then the workers that are lying horizontal are stood up and their colour becomes the new bid and usage colour for that tile.

#### Boat 4b

If a tile has already been bid for, or has previously been used for production, the owner of boat 4b does not have to follow the same colour rule (even if green workers have been used) when placing workers on the tile for production. They may alternatively use any coloured workers, including more than one different colour at the same time. When breaking the same colour rule in this way, any workers that do not follow the original colour used are placed lying horizontal, for ease of identification. The horizontal workers still count toward the six worker limit for workers using a single tile. Other players must continue to use the colour of the standing up workers when using or bidding for the tiles that contain the horizontal workers. If a tile has not previously been used or bid for, then this does not apply - the player must place their workers standing up in the usual way and, if more than one, they must be of the same colour as each other.

#### Home and other spring, summer and autumn tiles

#### Alehouse and Inn

A player places a worker on this tile and then draws the indicated number of workers from the bag, if available, and places these behind their screen.

#### Apprentice hall

A player places a worker on this tile and then takes a skill tile (or tiles if the apprentice hall had been upgraded) at random from the pile of facedown skill tiles and places this behind their screen.

#### Barn, Blacksmith, Stone yard and Timber yard

The owner of the tile will score points for each resource of the type shown, which is *on that tile* at the end of winter. (Any resources scored in this way cannot also be used for scoring in conjunction with the jeweller, mercer's guild, watermill and windmill tiles.)

#### Brewer

A player places a worker on this tile and then places a skill tile of any type face down in the pile of skill tiles. The player then draws the indicated number of workers from the bag, if available, and places these behind their screen.

#### Carpenter, Mason and Smelter

A player places a worker on this tile and then places a skill tile of the type shown face down in the pile of skill tiles. The player then takes the resources indicated from the stock, if available. The resources are placed on this tile if the tile used is in the player's own village. The resources are placed on the player's home tile if the tile used is in another player's village.

#### Fair, Peddler and Store.

A player places a worker on this tile and then places an additional worker in the bag of the colour indicated. The player then takes the indicated number of green workers from the stock, if available. No green workers can be taken from the bag if there are insufficient remaining in the stock of green workers.

#### Farrier, Homes 1 to 6, Stable and Wainwright

When a worker is placed on one of these tiles (in any player's village), the player may transport resources in their own village and upgrade buildings in their own village.

The player may move up to the number of resources indicated by the cart and upgrade up to the number of village tiles indicated by the upgrade icons (one or two).

The transportation of resources must be along roads. The number of resources indicated on the transport tile can be split between one or more resources of the same or different types. For example if the transport capacity is two, then two resources can be moved to an adjacent tile(s) or one resource can be moved two tiles.

#### Forge, Goldsmith, Sawmill, Sculptor and Well

These tiles only generate points at the end of the game.

#### Gold mine, Key mine, Keystone quarry, Keywood, Miner, Quarryman and Woodcutter

A player places a worker on this tile then takes the resources indicated from the stock, if available. Any resources generated in a player's own village are placed on the tile generating the resources. Any resources generated in another player's village or from a tile being bid for are placed on the player's home tile.

#### Hiring fair

A player places a worker on this tile and then places a skill tile of any type face down next to the pile of skill tiles. The player then takes two (or three if the hiring fair tile has been upgraded) skill tiles at random from the pile of face down skill tiles and places these tiles behind their screen. The skill tile they played is then mixed in with the remaining skill tiles in the pile.

#### Tavern

A player places a worker on this tile and then discards an additional worker. The player then draws the indicated number of workers from the bag, if available, and places these behind their screen.

After the workers have been drawn, the discarded worker is placed in the bag. The discarded worker cannot be used to make up any shortfall of workers in the bag.

#### Workshop

If this tile is not upgraded, a player places a worker on this tile then takes one of the three resources indicated from the stock, if available. If this tile has been upgraded, a player places a worker on this tile then takes all three of the resources indicated from the stock, if available. Any resources generated in a player's own village are placed on the tile generating the resources. Any resources generated in another player's village or from a tile being bid for are placed on the player's home tile.

### Winter tiles

#### Apothecary

The owner gets 3 points for every 5 workers (including green) that they own at the end of the game. Note this includes workers which were played into the player's own village in winter.

#### Craftsman's guild

The owner gets 3 points for each set of blue, red and yellow workers that they own at the end of the game. Note this includes workers which were played into the player's own village in winter. Note also that green workers cannot be used in substitution for one of the other colour of workers.

#### Jeweller

The owner gets 2 points for every gold resource they own at the end of the game instead of the usual 1 point.

#### Key guild

The owner gets 10 points for every 5 skill tiles the player possesses at the end of the game.

#### Keythedral

The owner scores 12 points.

#### Key market

The owner scores 2 points for each green worker which they own at the end of the game.

#### Mercer's guild

The owner gets 5 points for each set of three different resources the player owns at the end of the game. Note that gold can be used in substitution of any of the other types of resource, but if it is used in this way the gold does not then also score 1 point for being gold.

#### Scholar

The owner selects one type of skill tile which they possess. The owner gets 3 points for each skill tile of that type that the player possesses at the end of the game.

#### Scribes

The owner gets 10 points for each set of three different skill tiles the player possesses at the end of the game.

#### Village hall

The owner selects one colour of worker which they own. The player gets 1 point for each worker of that colour that the player has at the end of the game. Note this includes workers which were played into the player's own village in winter.

#### Watermill

The owner selects one type of resource which they own. The player gets 1 point for each resources of that type that the player has at the end of the game. Note there is no point in the player choosing gold as gold already scores 1 point at the end of the game and cannot be scored twice.

#### Windmill

The owner gets 5 points for every 5 resources of any type that the player has at the end of the game.
