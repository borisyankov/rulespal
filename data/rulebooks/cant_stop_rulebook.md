# Can't Stop Rulebook

## OBJECT

To be the first player to reach the top of any three columns.

## EQUIPMENT

* 1 game board
* 3 markers
* 4 dice
* 44 colored squares â€” 11 squares each of four different colors.

## SET UP

1. Each player chooses a color and takes all the squares of that color.
2. Each player rolls two dice. The player who rolls the highest number goes first; play then proceeds, in turn, to that player's left.

## PLAYING

1. To start your turn, roll all four dice. Look your roll over carefully. Then split your roll in half in any way you wish, and add the two dice in each half. The purpose: to create a pair of numbers.

*Example:* Let's say you roll a 1-5-4-6. With this roll, you can create any of the following pairs: **6 and 10** (1+5) and (4+6); or **5 and 11** (1+4) and (5+6); or **9 and 7** (5+4) and (1+6).

1. The pair of numbers you choose to create represents the two columns into which you must now place markers.

*Example:* On this roll of 1-5-4-6, let's say you choose 6 and 10 as your pair. You must now place a marker into the "6" column and another marker into the "10" column.

*When first placing a marker into a particular column, always place it onto the space at the bottom of that column.*

3. In this game you may roll more than once on a single turn. On each additional roll, you also create a pair of numbers in the same way.
   1. Let's say you roll again and create a pair that includes a number you've already chosen. When this happens, *move* the marker *up* one space in that number's column.
   2. Let's say you roll again and decide to create a pair with a new number. If you have another marker left, you must place it into the new marker's column.

*Examples:* From your first roll you already have a marker in both the "6" and "10" columns. On the same turn you then roll a 2-4-3-5. If you choose to create 6 and 8 as your pair, move the marker in the "6" column up one space and place the third marker into the "8" column. If, instead, you choose to create 5 and 9 as your pair, you must place the third marker into either of these columns and ignore the other column. If you choose to create 7 and 7 as your pair, you must place the third marker two spaces up in the "7" column.

4. You may continue to roll as long as your last roll allowed you either to place a marker or to move one up. If you prefer, *you may stop your turn whenever you wish*. To stop, simply replace each marker with one of your colored squares.

### Placing a Marker

a) If you choose a column that *does* not already have one of your colored squares in it, place the marker onto the space at the *bottom* of that column.
b) If you choose a column that *does* already have one of your colored squares in it, place the marker onto the space *directly* above your colored square.
c) You may place a marker onto a space that's already occupied by an opponent's colored square.
d) If you *can* place a marker on your roll, you *must*.

*Example:* Let's say you've already placed markers into the "3" and "6" columns and you roll a 2-4-5-5. If you want to move up the marker in column "6", you must place the third marker into column "10". Otherwise you must place the third marker either into column "7" or "9".

**Blowing It.** When your roll *will not* allow you either to place a marker or to move one up, you've "blown it" and must end your turn. *Remove all of the markers* that you've placed, but *leave all of your colored squares* that are already on the board.

*Remember:* As soon as you've placed all three markers on your turn, each additional roll on that turn must *allow* you to move up *at least one of the markers.* Otherwise you've "blown it" and your turn ends.

**Winning a Column.** You win a column as soon as you place one of your *colored squares* onto the number at the top of that column. If any of your opponents already has a colored square in a column that you win, he or she must remove that square immediately.

a) *A marker on the number at the top of a column does not mean you've won that column.*

*Example:* Let's say you've placed markers into columns "3", "6" and "8", and that you've just moved the marker in column "6" to the number at the top. You could stop your turn now and win that column by replacing each of the markers with one of your colored squares. You decide, however, to roll again -- hoping to win columns "3" and "8", too. You roll a 2-4-5-5. Tough luck. You have no more markers to place, and you can't move the marker in column "6" any higher than it already is. So you've "blown it" and must end your turn by removing *all* of the markers that you've placed. In other words, you do not win column "6".

b) *You may not place a marker into a column that someone has already won--even if you've won that column yourself.*

*Example:* Let's say that columns "6", "8" and "10" are already won, and you roll a 2-4-4-6. You've "blown it"-- even if you still have markers to place.

## WINNING

The winner is the first player to win any three columns.

## A STRATEGY HINT

The shortest columns are not the easiest to win. Why? Because on any given roll, the numbers you're most likely to create are 6, 7 or 8. Consider this fact when placing markers and when deciding whether or not to stop your turn.

## VARIANTS

For more exciting games with two or three players, increase the winning condition to four or five columns (the game will last a little longer, though).

The two following variants can also be used, but not both at the same time:

A. If your marker lands on a space that has another player's colored square on it, simply skip that space and place your marker on the next available space. This accelerates the game, especially with four players.

B. If your marker lands on a space that has another player's colored square on it, you must roll the dice again whether you want to or not, until your marker leaves the space with the other player's colored square, or you "blow it". In this variant, as in variant A, there are no stacks of colored markers, but this one can be quite "dangerous", especially with four players, because you are virtually forced to take risks.
