**So Clover!** is a cooperative word-association game. Play as a team to beat your high score!

Draw Keyword cards and secretly write their **common features** on your Clover board; these are your **Clues**. Then work together to try to figure out each player’s Keywords. At the end of the game, add up your score according to how many Keywords you found and write it in the Record of Legends. Try to beat your highest score each game!

## SETUP

1. Give a Clover board and marker to each player.
2. Shuffle the Keyword cards and make a **face-down** deck within reach of everyone.
3. Everyone draws **4 Keyword cards** and **randomly** places them on the recessed spots on their Clover board. Make sure **no one** can see your cards.

## GAMEPLAY

The game plays over **two phases**:

1. **Choosing Clues**: individual phase.
2. **Resolution**: team phase.

### 1. CHOOSING CLUES

Simultaneously, all players picks up their Clover board and secretly looks at the 8 Keywords that are on the **outside** edges of their cards. Notice there are **2 Keywords** that form a **Pair** below each Clue Zone on your Clover board. There are 4 Pairs on your Clover board.

For each of your 4 Pairs, secretly think of a Clue that ties their 2 Keywords together. Clues must be a single word (compound words are allowed) and can be a common noun, proper noun, acronym, number or onomatopoeia.

*Examples: Rabbit, Clooney, FBI, 13 and Bzzzz are therefore valid Clues.*

Write this word on the corresponding Clue Zone of your Clover board.

#### Invalid Clues

* Neither one of your Keywords or its translation into another language.
*Example: Amour cannot be used to connect “Love” and “France”.*
* A word in the same family as a Keyword.
*Example: Prince cannot be used to suggest a Pair with “Princess” and “Brother”.*
* Made-up words.
*Example: Cuppajo cannot be used to suggest a Pair with “Mug” and “Morning”.*

#### Examples

• *For the Pair “House” and “Firefighter”,you could write “Station” (the fire department’s house) in the corresponding Clue Zone.*
• *For the Pair “Sheep” and “Clothing”,you could write “Wool” (sheep’s wool is used to make clothes) in the corresponding Clue Zone.*

***ADVICE:** Certain connections may seem difficult, but don’t worry. Simply write the first word that pops into your head. Other players might surprise you with their guesses!*

After you write your **4 Clues**, remove all of the Keyword cards from your Clover board. Then, without looking at it, draw **1 new card** and shuffle it with your other 4 Keyword cards. Put your Clover board down in front of you and put your 5 cards on top of it in a face-down pile.

When everyone has finished these steps, continue to the Resolution phase.

### 2. RESOLUTION

During this phase, choose the first player to be the Spectator while all other players look at their Clover board. The **Spectator** **cannot communicate in any way** during this phase. Every player will be the Spectator one time during each game.

The Spectator places their Clover board and 5 Keyword cards face up in the middle of the table. Using the Clues, the **other players** work **together** to figure out the Spectator’s Pairs and put the cards back in the correct spaces on the Clover board.

**If there is a disagreement** on where cards should go, the player sitting **to the left of the Spectator** makes the final decision.

***ADVICE:** During this phase, feel free to place the Keyword cards on the Clover board to help visualize possible combinations and explain your reasoning to help your team reach a decision.*

When players agree on the placement of cards on the Clover board, the Spectator **verifies** the Keywords.

### VERIFICATION

#### First attempt

##### Perfect

**All Pairs are placed on the Clover board correctly**: gain **1 point per card** and an **extra 2 points** for having found all the Keywords on the first try! *(total 6 points)*.

##### Error

**At least one Pair is placed on the Clover board incorrectly**: the Spectator removes the incorrect card(s) without saying anything and puts them in the middle of the table.

The other players have a **second and final attempt**.

#### Second attempt

After the players agree on the new card placement, the Spectator removes any incorrect card(s) and puts them in the middle of the table. Gain **1 point per correct card** *(0 to 4 possible points)*.

Then, the Spectator turns over their Clover board, writes the number of points in the middle, and discards the 5 Keyword cards they used.

The player to their left becomes the next Spectator and a new Resolution phase begins.

## END OF THE GAME

After every player has been the Spectator one time, the game ends.

You can evaluate your team’s deduction skills by adding up the points you all gained and writing your score in the Record of Legends.

Will you be able to beat your high score?

## ADD A CHALLENGE

Once you are familiar with the game, you can add a new challenge to your games by increasing the number of Keyword cards you add before the Resolution phase.

In this case, agree on the number of Keywords cards to add. This amount is applied to every player during the game.
