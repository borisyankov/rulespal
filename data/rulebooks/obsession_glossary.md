## The Fairchild Family Some Background

> It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
>
> — Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen

Some decades after these words were penned, the sudden arrival of Charles Fairchild, Esq—a single man in possession of a good fortune-into a Derbyshire neighbourhood did indeed elicit such feelings of ownership, however fanciful, in the minds of more than one daughter; yet it should be noted that the neighbouring young gentlemen were equally enamoured of his sister, the refined and beautiful Miss Fairchild.

The Fairchild siblings had everything to recommend them-pleasing countenances, the best connections, and substantial wealth, with the likelihood of inheriting a greater fortune-but little else was known. Neither had been seen since the near death of Charles eleven years earlier, and then tragedy struck, devastating a prominent, centuries-old Derbyshire family.

> Happiness is but a mere episode in the general drama of pain.
>
> — Thomas Hardy

Henry, Earl Fairchild, the eldest of three brothers, inherited the Fairchild title and fortune before Queen Victoria ascended the throne. Pale and prone to illness, the eldest Fairchild lacked the robust constitution of his siblings: stout Edward and lively William, the youngest Fairchild brother and eventual father of Charles and Elizabeth.

Edward, whose manners left something to be desired and who had a weakness for the bottle, harboured a deep bitterness that the least fit of the Fairchild sons had inherited Alderley Hall, the beloved family estate. He quarrelled with Henry at every turn, and his sharp tongue, often loosened in revelry, brought him into disrepute for airing family concerns in public.

William possessed the most agreeable and unaffected manner of the three; he cared nothing for family politics and tended to avoid his brothers. For a time, his popularity in Derbyshire society was unrivalled; he socialised with an easy grace, hunted and rode with skill, and danced at every ball, and with every young lady, a delight to all.

Then, while visiting a friend in the North Riding of Yorkshire, William spied Charlotte Kings- bury at a ball given by her father, Viscount Hazelwood, and the most loquacious Fairchild brother was struck dumb. William and Charlotte were married sixteen months later, settling in Yorkshire near the estate of Charlotte's parents at the insistence of Lord Hazelwood.

Back in Derbyshire, Earl Fairchild was finally spared the public carping of Edward when the middle Fairchild brother married suddenly and departed for Hertfordshire. Rumour had the disagreeable Edward guilty of licentious behaviour with a young actress, his sudden departure no coincidence.

> I think people really marry far too much; it is such a lottery after all, and for a poor woman a very doubtful happiness.
>
> — Queen Victoria

Oddly, the oldest brother became the last Fairchild to marry. Henry's wife, Margaret Gable, was regarded by everyone as kind-hearted and generous, a woman without duplicity. With only one sibling and few relations, Margaret longed for a house filled with sons and daughters, dear friends, merriment, and bustle. That the couple produced no children became an enduring heartbreak for Margaret; Alderley Hall soon became as silent as the grave with Edward gone, William staying close to Charlotte's family many miles to the north, and the unsocial Earl Fairchild frequently in poor health.

In Yorkshire, the birth of Charles and then Elizabeth four years later finally moved William to accept a standing invitation from his eldest brother to visit. William and Henry shared little affection, but the youngest Fairchild often declared his admiration for his sister-in-law Margaret, and he thought the children might bring her pleasure.

The arrival one summer of the Yorkshire Fairchilds captivated Margaret, and Henry, too. Henry's gentle wife was delighted at last to have children to spoil. For a period of six years, the eldest and youngest Fairchild brothers grew closer, with much- anticipated summer trips to Derbyshire becoming an annual affair.

Then Charles took severely ill during a visit, and it was thought he might be lost. The lad rallied and spent a summer slowly regaining his strength, with a physician-and his Aunt Margaret-in almost constant attendance. Margaret's heart grew deeply attached in a time of trial, and it ached with the departure of her precious niece and nephew that autumn.

It was a devastating heartbreak for Margaret when Charlotte refused to allow the children to return to Alderley Hall.

> Terror made me cruel ...
>
> — Emily Bronte, Wuthering Heights

Charlotte Fairchild was a gentle woman, but a terror had filled her during her son's long illness, along with a belief that Henry's frequent infirmity, unwholesome pallor, and noxious treatments were somehow at fault. The terror fixed so firmly in her mind that no persuasion of William's would convince her-or her Yorkshire relations-to let Charles and Elizabeth return to Derbyshire to again warm the halls and hearts of Margaret and the earl.

Within the year, Henry, Earl Fairchild, succumbed to a cruel, wasting disease. In death, Henry exacted a measure of justice against his brother Edward; the Fairchild earldom had never been subject to an entail, and Henry, who could never give children to his beloved Margaret, left her everything else: the estates, the fortune, Alderley Hall-everything, in fact, except the title.

Tragedy had by no means finished with Margaret, Dowager Countess Fairchild; eight short months after the death of Henry, her only sibling, her brother, died when he was thrown from a horse, breaking his neck. His wife, Ethel, just three years married and herself childless, soon joined the Dowager Countess in Derbyshire, mutual companions coping with loneliness and loss, broken- hearted and withdrawn.

> I have had my share of sorrows-more than the common lot, perhaps, but I have borne them ill. I have broken where I should have bent; and have mused and brooded, when my spirit should have mixed with all God's great creation.
>
> — Charles Dickens

Ten years after the death of Henry Fairchild, while on vacation in the south of France, William- haunted by regret for his role in denying Margaret the treasured company of her niece and nephew- persuaded his wife that the time had come to reunite Charles and Elizabeth with their beloved Aunt. Charlotte, herself feeling that she might have gone a bit too far, acknowledged that Charles and Elizabeth, now young adults, were the picture of vigour and health.

Charlotte Fairchild relented. "They so loved Alderley Hall," she said.

*The return of Charles and Elizabeth to Derbyshire was delayed when a tragic accident crossing the Channel led to the deaths of their parents. Now, a year later, with their mourning completed, the siblings finally arrive at Alderley Hall, amazed at the new energy that has taken Derbyshire ... and the Obsession gripping them all!*

### £100 and £500 Coins

**Description: Currency denominations used to bank wealth and make purchases.**

*Thematic Material: One hundred pounds (£100) in the middle of the 19th century would be equivalent to over £7000 in 2020 (or over $9000).*

Gameplay Detail: One hundred and five hundred pound coins are used to provide a convenient method for saving money from round to round. Furthermore, all purchases are made in increments of £100, making these convenient denominations. Pounds are not limited; in the unlikely event that coins run out, select an appropriate substitute and add to the supply.

### Active Hand

**Description: The hand of gentry cards from which a player chooses guests and family to attend activities, provided she has both the reputation and servants to support them.**

*Thematic Material: The guests in a player's Active Hand comprise those acquaintances in the family's circle of friends who should next be invited to visit. Propriety requires that friends not be neglected, and the Active Hand reflects those connections who are perhaps overdue to attend an appropriate social occasion at the estate.*

Gameplay Detail: A player's gentry card deck is composed of an Active Hand and a face-up discard pile. The Active Hand contains those family members and guests from whom the player must choose when issuing invitations to attend an activity. Once a family member or guest attends an activity, that card is placed in the player's discard pile and is not available again until that player passes and reclaims her deck. If a player does not have sufficient qualifying guests to attend one of the activities listed on a tile in her country estate organiser, she must pass or choose to hire servants by playing the Butler's Room (which is the lone 'playable' tile that does not require a gentry card).

### Activity

**Description: The main engine of each turn, an Activity is the social event hosted in a particular room or outdoor space at a player's country estate. The Activity is seen in small white letters on each improvement tile immediately below the tile name.**

*Thematic Material: The independently wealthy landed gentry of Victorian Britain derived their income from legacy wealth and property, and generally did not need (or want) to work. The gentry lifestyle was therefore filled with social activities such as formal dinners, balls, hunting, riding, picnics, and recitals, all of which may take place in a game of Obsession.*

*Activities are limited by the family's reputation (the largest number on each player board). This restriction simply reflects limitations on a family emerging from a period of frugal living-a family who has just begun renovating their country house and expanding the domestic staff can hardly host a ball; it would be a disaster and few would come. Only when a family has made improvements, cultivated the gardens, hired and trained domestic staff, and re-entered society with a purpose can they host balls or brave recitals, formal dinners, and shooting parties. The increasing reputation on the player board reflects the family's increasing ability to stage grand events attended by the most desirable guests.*

Gameplay Detail: Improvement tiles represent a room or outdoor space where an Activity may take place. These Activities are the focus of *Obsession* gameplay. Each turn, a player will either pass or select an Activity to host at their country estate.

### Admirer Bonus

**Description: A bonus favour of two reputation granted when a player's eligible young female family member is sought out at a social activity and made the object of conspicuous attention by a male prestige guest.**

*Thematic Material: A favourable marriage for a daughter from a family struggling with money, image, and social standing was a common obsession in Victorian Britain and in the literature of the 19th century. Few happenings excited a family's optimism as much as the young lady of the house being paid court at a social event by an established, wealthy, and debonair single gentleman.*

Gameplay Detail: The card for each family's eligible young lady references an Admirer Bonus. This bonus is only activated when the young lady's card is played at the same activity with a male prestige guest. The male prestige guest is identified by the presence of two *fleur-de-lis* in the upper left-hand corner of the card and a reputation of three or more. When a male prestige guest is seen spending time with the young lady at an activity, the player receives two additional reputation during the 'enjoy favours' stage of her turn.

Note that the Charles Fairchild card does not reference a reputation level. The card does, however, have two *fleur-de-lis* in the upper left-hand corner (and also shows the Fairchild family crest in place of a reputation level); there- fore, Charles is a prestige guest, and he does enable the Admirer Bonus.

### Barn

**Description: The Barn is the service location that references an investment in the groundskeeping staff, which enhances the family's reputation when estate activities are hosted.**

*Thematic Material: Few aesthetic pursuits more iconically represent 19th-century English culture than the enjoyment of gardens and manicured grounds. A serious investment in the beloved grounds of the family's estate would draw notice and praise, and enhance the family's reputation in the area.*

Gameplay Detail: The Barn service tile appears randomly in the Builders' Market and has a discount of £100 attached to the purchase price. When a player acquires this tile, it is placed under SERVICE in the country estate organiser. On all future turns when an estate tile is played, the player increases his reputation by one on his player board reputation wheel.

Note that the Barn is worth 2 victory points; all other service tiles are worth 0 or 1 victory point.

### Brushing Room

**Description: The Brushing Room is the service location where footmen are trained to serve as valets when staffing is inadequate. This allows players to use white footman meeples as if they were green valet meeples when providing service to gentlemen guests.**

*Thematic Material: The Brushing Room was a small room in a superior house for brushing garments. There, a male servant experienced with providing personal service to the gentlemen of the house (butler, underbutler, valet) could educate a footman being called upon in a time of need on the proper care of a wardrobe.*

Gameplay Detail: The Brushing Room service tile appears randomly in the Builders' Market and has a discount of £200 attached to the purchase price. When a player acquires this tile, it is placed under SERVICE in the country estate organiser. On all future turns, the player may use a footman as a valet when providing service to a gentleman, *but only when a valet is unavailable*.

### Builders' Holiday

**Description: An event on round number 11 on the round track (round number 13 in extended play) where players are able to purchase as many improvements from the Builders' Market as their resources allow. This special round is marked by the quarried pile of rocks seen to the right.**

*Thematic Material: The quarry symbol (pile of rocks) on the round track represents the sudden availability of cheap building materials or an influx of new skilled craftsmen that ignites a building boom.*

Gameplay Detail: Normal turns limit a player to one purchase from the market. During the Builders' Holiday, however, purchases are unlimited, provided the player has (or can acquire) the necessary wealth. This presents the player with a unique opportunity to acquire critical tiles to complete objectives or to excel in a courtship category.

If a player purchases more than one improvement tile from the market, the remaining tiles are moved leftward, opening up blank spaces on the right side of the market row. These open spaces are filled with new tiles drawn from the tile bag and placed in tile sorting number order.

### Builders' Market

**Description: The eight spaces on the central supply board where improvement tiles available for purchase are placed (six in the open market and two in the tile reserve). These tiles represent potential capital additions or renovations to a country house and its surrounding grounds.**

*Thematic Material: The Builders' Market is not historic, but a device used in Obsession for managing purchases in such a way as to reflect the relative scarcity of skilled labour and high-end building materials in mid-19th century England.*

Gameplay Detail: The rules for initially populating the Builders' Market are covered in the Rulebook, page 5. The rules for buying from the Builders' Market are described in the Rulebook, pages 10-12. There are two scenarios beyond initial population that deserve some review:

**Duplicate Tiles:** In the 2nd edition, the revised market population rules changed how duplicate tiles are managed. Previously, duplicates occupied two spaces in the market, resulting in fewer choices and a stagnant display. Now, duplicate tiles are stacked on top of each other; if a player purchases one of them, the other remains available for purchase. If the market is refreshed, both tiles are removed.

**Undesirable Market Population:** On rare occasions, the initial population will be nonsensical (i.e., three sets of duplicates, mostly one category, etc.). Do not hesitate, if all players agree, to redraw the *initial* population so that it reflects an interesting and thematically sensible variety. Please note that this option is not available when the Builders' Market is refreshed in the middle of a game; a player takes a risk when refreshing the market, and he must live with the consequences!

### Builders' Market Reserve

**Description: The two spaces on the central supply board to the left of the open market where service tiles are placed after Season 1 and improvement tiles with a prestige rating of 1 are placed after Season 2. These tiles remain available for purchase, but are prevented from clogging the open market late in the game.**

*Thematic Material: The Builders' Market reflects the relative scarcity of skilled labour and high-end building materials in mid-19th century England. However, some minor, low-cost improvements-most notably simple service enhancements and outdoor animal accommodations-would be locally accessible to any established family. The Builders' Market Reserve houses those basic options later in the game.*

Gameplay Detail: Since the 2nd printing of Obsession introduced the Builders' Market Reserve, a review of the new Supply Board will be helpful.

The old Builders' Market is the six spaces framed in yellow, which is now called the 'open market.' Tiles are drawn from the purple tile bag and move to the left through the open market as improvements are purchased and spaces left empty. During certain times in the game, however, some tiles bypass the open market and are placed in the Builders' Market Reserve. The reserve is framed in red and is used to manage low-value tiles as the game progresses.

To summarize the reserve rules, detailed in the Rulebook,
page 12:

* After the 1st courtship is over, the Service Tile Reserve activates, and all SERVICE tiles currently in the market are moved to the Service Tile Reserve space. For the remainder of the game, all SERVICE tiles drawn are moved immediately to the reserve. Players may purchase from the reserve, and the reserve is not affected by a market refresh (only the open market is affected).

* After the 2nd courtship is over, the PR 1 (Prestige Rating 1) Tile Reserve activates, and all PR 1 tiles currently in the market are moved to the PR 1 Reserve space. For the remainder of the game, all PR 1 tiles drawn are moved immediately to the reserve. Players may purchase from the reserve, and the reserve is not affected by a market refresh (only the open market is affected).

**Solo Use:** Solo players may use the reserve. Service courtships are easier to win and objectives are easier to complete, but the scavenging action, which ignores the reserves, is more consequential (stealing tiles of greater value on average).

### Butler

**Description: The Butler is represented by a tall dark blue meeple and is used to provide service for the most prestigious events (such as a music recital, formal affair, or grand ball). The Butler is also the hiring manager for new servants.**

*Thematic Material: The Butler in Victorian Britain was the senior domestic servant (along with the housekeeper), responsible for the smooth running of the house. In addition, he was in direct charge of the dining room, wine cellar, and pantry, as well as the male service staff and all country house activities. The Butler also wielded significant power as the ultimate arbiter of who was admitted to visit the family.*

Gameplay Detail: The Butler is required when new servants are hired or when a proposal is made to recruit a servant from another estate. After hiring/recruiting servants, he and the new members of the domestic staff are placed in the Expended Service section of the player board for orientation. These meeples will then be rotated normally into Available Service. Like the housekeeper and underbutler, he is a loyal servant who cannot be lured away with a recruiting action.

### Butler's Pantry

**Description: The Butler's Pantry is the service tile improvement that provides an underbutler in the form of a tall black meeple taken from the Servants for Hire section of the supply board.**

*Thematic Material: The Butler's Pantry in Victorian Britain was far more than just a domestic storage room. There, the butler coordinated the wine service as well as the security and storage of the valuable crystal and china used as the elegant centrepiece of fine Victorian dining. Common servants were not usually permitted entry to the Butler's Pantry; only the underbutler serving in his jack-of- all-trades role in support of the butler had routine access.*

Gameplay Detail: The Butler's Pantry service tile appears randomly in the Builders' Market and has a premium £100 attached to the purchase price. When a player acquires this tile, it is placed under SERVICE in the country estate organiser, and a tall black underbutler meeple is taken from the supply board and placed in the Expended Service section of the player board. This meeple will then be rotated normally into Available Service.

The underbutler functions in any male service capacity: as the butler, a valet, or a footman. The meeple is placed as if it were one of these other male servants and rotated accordingly. **Note:** The underbutler may be used as a butler, valet, or footman even if one of these servants is available.

### Butler's Room

**Description: The service improvement tile that is part of the initial setup-it is a starting tile-present in every player's country estate organiser. This is the only service tile that does not confer an ongoing benefit and is 'played'-the tile is placed onto the player board with the butler meeple in order to hire new servants.**

*Thematic Material: The Butler's Room is not historic; in Obsession, it refers to a small office or personal space where the butler might interview servants. The additional action on the back side of this tile-to recruit a servant from another player-reflects a not uncommon practice where elite servants might be hired away from a nearby house.*

Gameplay Detail: The Butler's Room is used when a player
wants to acquire additional servants. Instead of choosing a
gentry-oriented activity to host during a standard turn, the
player takes the Butler's Room tile from the organiser and
places it on the player board. The butler (or underbutler)
meeple is mandatory for this activity.

No gentry cards are played when this tile is used; instead, the player may take two servants from the Servants for Hire area on the supply board. These two servants may be any combination of valets, lady's maids, and footmen-they may be the same (e.g., two valets) or different (e.g., a footman & a lady's maid). Hired servants are then placed in Expended Service along with the butler to be oriented to their new house.

After this tile has been played for the first time (i.e., flipped to the backside with the rose), a new ability is unlocked. Future use of the Butler's Room permits either another hiring action as described above or the following new ability:

* Recruit one valet, lady's maid, or footman servant from another player (from any location on that competitor's player board). This newly hired servant is placed with the butler (or underbutler, if used) in the Expended Service section of the player board to be oriented. Tall meeples-the butler, housekeeper, & underbutler-are loyal and cannot be recruited.

This Butler's Room may be used as many times as a player wishes, although once meeples are gone from the Servants for Hire section of the supply board, only the ***Recruit One Servant*** action can be performed. If only one servant is left in the Servants for Hire area on the supply board, the player may only hire that one servant; she cannot hire one servant and recruit a second one.

A player may purchase from the Builders' Market after the Butler's Room is played, just as in a regular turn.

### Casual Guests

**Description: The 50 gentry playing cards (15 starter Casual Guests and 35 regular Casual Guests) identified by a single *fleur-de-lis*. These guests represent guests of modest or possibly questionable reputation.**

*Thematic Material: Casual Guests comprise those acquaintances at or below the social standing of the four families at the beginning of the game. In addition to loyal, long-standing friendships, these guests may include impoverished friends, young men at times inclined to drink and revelry, and even a scattering of possibly gauche but enormously wealthy American heiresses looking to experience British society.*

*Guests with negative characteristics are not definitively known to be conniving, immoral, or manipulative people. Each type of unsavoury guest joins the circle of friends as an acquaintance in good standing. Rumours may be swirling around some, but such gossip might be attributed to the jealous behaviour of others. At first blush, such guests might be under attack, apparently wholesome and in need of defence. Over time, the rumours might prove true, and then the continued society of such people would have consequences. The appropriate response is to part company with such unsavoury personalities, but even that must be done with decorum.*

Gameplay Detail: There are two groups of Casual Guests in Obsession-starter guests, who can be identified by the closed crown in the upper left-hand corner of the card, and the remaining Casual Guests.

There are 50 Casual Guests, and 20 of them (40%) possess some negative characteristic that ***may***, over time, make them undesirable visitors to a player's country house. These unwholesome guests are classified as cads, scoundrels, paupers, gossips, adventuresses, and American heiresses.

Casual Guests are identified on improvement tiles and playing cards by a single *fleur-de-lis*. When a new Casual Guest invitation is extended by another guest, family member, or activity favour, it will reference one *fleur-de-lis* to indicate which guest deck on the supply board should be used.

When a Casual Guest card is taken from the supply, it should be shown to the other players-the comings and goings of gentry are never a secret in the county-then placed into the player's active hand available for immediate use.

### Charles & Elizabeth Fairchild

**Description: The two gentry cards representing the dashing heir to the Fairchild fortune and his refined and beautiful sister. They are distinguished by name and a unique crest in the upper left-hand corner of the card enclosed in a blue frame.**

*Thematic Material: In the lives of the landed gentry in Victorian Britain, advantageous marriages were a central theme. Marrying well was as desirable as marrying poorly was loathed, and love rarely had the power to break down such unromantic considerations. In Obsession, Charles and Elizabeth Fairchild represent the ultimate opportunity for families recovering from hard times to marry exceedingly well and form a highly advantageous connection.*

*Charles and Elizabeth come to Derbyshire from Yorkshire under tragic circumstances: the deaths of their parents on holiday. They arrive an unknown addition to Derbyshire society; the entire county is eager for any information about the Fairchild siblings.*

*Early news spreads: Charles is reserved and dignified, while Elizabeth, who shared her late mother's love of society, has begun inviting prestigious Yorkshire guests of her acquaintance to visit.*

Gameplay Detail: The cards representing Charles and Elizabeth Fairchild are kept near the round track, where courtship events will be resolved. The winner of a courtship event takes one of the Fairchild cards into her active hand for use during the next season. Driven by romantic interest, Charles and Elizabeth Fairchild will attend any event regardless of the reputation of the hosting family. The Fairchild cards are managed like any other card once placed in hand after a successful courtship.

The favours granted by Charles and Elizabeth are not the same. Charles grants a favour of three reputation, while Elizabeth has favours of two reputation and an invitation to a prestige guest. Note that Charles enables the admirer bonus for the young lady of any house, meaning that a visit from Charles can generate five reputation. Elizabeth, if attending an activity with the heir of any house, would generate two reputation, plus one from the heir for a total of three; she, however, also possesses a powerful prestige invitation favour.

At the conclusion of the first, second, and third seasons, the Fairchild card is returned to the round track area ***before*** the outcome of the next courtship. After the final courtship (fourth season), the Fairchild card chosen by the courtship winner (along with its significant 8 victory points) remains in the player's hand for end game scoring.

### Clear Player Board

**Description: The eighth and final action that takes place at the end of each player's turn.**

*Thematic Material: Flipping improvement tiles when the board is cleared represents experience gained by the family and domestic staff in hosting a specific activity.*

### Country Estate Organiser

**Description: The header tile that organises improvements into five categories-Essentials, Service, Estate, Prestige, and Sporting.**

*Thematic Material: The Country Estate Organiser groups renovated spaces to help define an estate's 'personality.'For example, a player who invests in such a way as to maximise the grand outdoor spaces-gardens, gazebos, kennels, paddocks-would possess a very different estate as compared with a player who focuses on art galleries, a statuary, smoking rooms, and libraries.*

*Concurrent with the renovation of the country estate, news and gossip about the interests of Charles and Elizabeth Fairchild define a profile of their perfect house and grounds. The player whose estate renovations best mirror the interests of the Fairchild siblings enhances her chances of securing the very best connection.*

| ESSENTIALS | SERVICE | ESTATE | PRESTIGE | SPORTING |
|------------|---------|--------|----------|----------|
| Essentials are rooms that every reputable manor house contains: family spaces, libraries, eating rooms, etc. | Service rooms are devoted to the domestic staff and typically provide some increase in efficiency. | Estate spaces are those improvements, typically engaging the outdoors, which lend to the grand feel of the country estate. | Prestige improvements are rare, opulent, refined rooms that distinguish a manor house and greatly enhance the family's reputation. | Outdoor Sporting spaces are a hallmark of country living and accommodate hunting, animals, and friendly sporting contests. |

Gameplay Detail: *Obsession* groups tiles that generate similar activity favours. **Estate** tiles, featuring intensely social activities, all generate invitations to new guests. **Prestige** tiles host only the most sophisticated events and increase the family's reputation. **Sporting** tile activities provide the perfect setting for conversations about investments, politics, and overseas opportunities, and all such tiles generate wealth in pounds. Most **Essentials** tiles do not show a favour on the tile itself; however, closer examination shows that these tiles do offer a significant advantage: large numbers of guests (who all have their own favours). Finally, **Service** tiles grant valuable special abilities to the domestic staff.
