# Dixit: Odyssey Rulebook

## Table of Contents

## Box Contents

* 1 scoreboard
* 84 image cards
* 12 voting boards
* 24 voting tokens
* 12 wooden rabbits
* 1 rulebook

## Setup

Assemble the two parts of the scoreboard, then place it at the centre of the table. Each player chooses a voting board and then places the rabbit of the corresponding colour on the 0 space of the scoreboard. The 84 image cards are shuffled and 6 are dealt to each player. The remaining image cards form the draw pile.

* In a game with 3 to 6 players, each player takes only 1 voting token (no matter the colour).
* In a game with 7 to 12 players, each player takes 2 voting tokens (no matter the colour).

*Note: the image cards in your hand must not be seen by the other players.*

## Game Overview

### The Storyteller

Each turn, one player will be the storyteller. They examine the 6 image cards in their hand. Using one of them, they think of something to say and say it out loud (without revealing their card to the other players).

What they say can take various forms: it can be made up of one or several words, or even be nothing more than an onomatopoeia. It can be invented from scratch or take the form of works already existing (a line or two from a poem or song, the title of a movie or some other work, a proverb, etc.).

*Picking the first storyteller of the game: The first player to think of something to say should announce to the other players that they will be the storyteller for the first game turn.*

### Handing the image cards to the storyteller

The other players choose from among their 6 image cards the one they believe best illustrates what the storyteller has said. Each then gives their chosen image to the storyteller, without letting the other players see it. The storyteller shuffles the given image cards with their own, before revealing them randomly on the image spaces numbered 1 to 12 on the scoreboard.

### Finding the storyteller’s image: the vote

The goal for the players is to find the storyteller’s image from among those revealed. Each player secretly votes for the image they believe to be the storyteller’s (the storyteller does not participate) by using their voting board. For example, if a player believes that image number 3 is the storyteller’s, that player will place their voting token on space number 3 of their tablet. Once everyone has voted, each player reveals their voting board, and the storyteller reveals which was their image.

*Note: under no circumstances can a player vote for their own image!*

### Finding the storyteller’s image with 7 or more players

Each player may, if they wish to do so, vote for a second image if they want to increase their chance of success. They will use their second voting token to choose a second image from among those exposed.

### Scoring

* If all players find the storyteller’s image, or if no player finds it, the storyteller scores no points and the other players each score 2 points.
* In any other case, the storyteller scores 3 points as does any player who has found the storyteller’s image.
* Each player other than the storyteller scores 1 bonus point for each vote earned by their image (to a maximum of 3 bonus points).

The players move their rabbit token on the score track as many
spaces as they’ve gained points.

### Scoring with 7 or more players

* If all players find the storyteller’s image, or if no player finds it, the storyteller scores no points and the other players each score 2 points.
* In any other case, the storyteller scores 3 points as does any player who has found the storyteller’s image.
* Each player (other than the storyteller) scores one bonus point for each vote earned by their image, with a limit of 3 bonus points maximum (even if their image has earned more than 3 votes).
* Players who voted for only one image score 1 extra point if they have found the storyteller’s image.

### End of Turn

Each player refills their hand back up to 6 image cards. If there aren’t enough image cards in the draw pile for each player to refill their hand, the discarded image cards are shuffled to form a new draw pile. The new storyteller for the next turn is the player to the left of the previous storyteller (and so on, clockwise, for the subsequent game turns).

## End of the Game

The game ends at the end of a turn during which a player reaches or exceeds 30 points. The player with the most points wins the game. In case of a tie, the tied players share the victory.

## 3 Player Game

Players should have seven image cards in their hand instead of six. The players (except for the storyteller) each hand in two image cards (instead of just one). This way, 5 image cards are always revealed, and players must still find the storyteller’s image among those.

## Dixit Party – for 6 to 12 players

### Set-Up

Assemble the two parts of the scoreboard, then place it at the center of the table. Each player chooses a voting board and then places the rabbit of the corresponding color on the 0 space of the scoreboard. The 84 image cards are shuffled and 5 are dealt to each player. The remaining image cards form the draw pile.

Each player takes a green voting token. Only one of the players, who will be the storyteller for the first game turn, takes a red voting token in addition to his or her green voting token.

### Game Overview

#### The Storyteller

One of the players is the storyteller for the game turn. Before even looking at the image cards in his or her hand, the storyteller says something out loud to the other players (see the various forms of what the storyteller can say in the basic rules). Unlike the basic game, what the storyteller says has no meaning in regards to one of his or her image cards.

*Picking the first storyteller of the game: The first player to think of something to say announces to the other players that he or she will be the storyteller for the first game turn.*

#### Handing the image cards to the storyteller

Each player, including the storyteller, chooses an image from their hand which they believe best illustrates what the storyteller has said. Each then pass their chosen image to the storyteller who will shuffle them with his or her own, before revealing them randomly in the image spaces numbered 1 to 12 on the scoreboard.

#### Finding the most popular image: the vote

Each player (including the storyteller) will have to vote secretly, using his or her green vote token, for the image they believe best represents what the storyteller has said. The more players vote for the same image, the more points those players will score.

But be careful! The storyteller will also secretly vote for one of the exposed image cards, but this time with his or her red vote token. None of the votes earned by that image will be taken into account for scoring purposes. It is up to the storyteller, then, to think carefully about which image to vote for in order to deny points to as many opponents as possible... and for the other players to keep this in mind as they vote! Once everyone has voted, each player reveals his or her voting board.

*The turn’s storyteller will thus have used both their green vote token AND their red vote token. Players are allowed to vote for their own image cards.*

#### Scoring

* Each player scores as many points as the number of players (themselves included) who have voted for the same image as he or she did, with a limit of 5 points maximum.
* Players who have voted for the image that the storyteller has selected with his or her red token will score no points.
* A player who is the only one to vote for an image will score no points.

#### End of Turn

At the end of the turn, each player refills their hand back up to 5 image cards, then passes their hand face-down to their left neighbor. Used image cards are discarded. If there aren’t enough image cards in the draw pile for players to refill their hand, discarded image cards are shuffled to create a new draw pile. The new storyteller for the turn is the player to the left of the previous storyteller.

#### End of the game

The game ends when each player has been storyteller 1 time. The player with the most points is the winner. In case of a tie, the tied teams share the victory.

*For longer games, you can increase the number of times a player must be storyteller during the game.*

## Team Dixit - 6, 8, 10 or 12 players

### Set-Up

Assemble the two parts of the scoreboard, then place it at the center of the table. Teams of 2 players are then made. The 2 teammates should sit so that they are facing each other across the table.

Each team takes a voting board and then places the rabbit of the corresponding color on the 0 space of the scoreboard. The 84 image cards are shuffled and 4 are dealt to each player. The remaining image cards form the draw pile.

### Game Overview

#### The Storyteller

See the storyteller’s role on the basic game.

#### Handing the image cards to the Storyteller

After having listened to what the storyteller said, his or her teammate hands the storyteller an image representing as best as possible what was said. The 2 players of each team then agree as to which of them will hand an image to the storyteller (the 2 teammates can talk, but always in the presence of the other players and must never show or the image cards they have in hand). The storyteller then shuffles the image cards received and reveals them randomly in the spaces numbered 1 to 12 on the scoreboard.

#### Vote and Scoring

Neither a player who has given the storyteller an image nor the storyteller can take part in the vote. The vote and the scoring follow the basic rules (do not use the voting and scoring rules for 7 or more players).

*Note: Neither the storyteller’s teammate nor the storyteller may take part in the vote.*

#### End of Turn

At the end of the turn, each player refills their hand back up to 4 image cards. If there aren’t enough image cards in the draw pile for players to refill their hand, the discarded image cards are shuffled to form a new draw pile. The new storyteller is the player to the left of the previous storyteller.

#### End of the Game

The game ends when each player has been storyteller once. The team with the most points is declared winner. For longer games, you can increase the number of times a player must be storyteller during the game. In case of a tie, the tied players share the victory.
