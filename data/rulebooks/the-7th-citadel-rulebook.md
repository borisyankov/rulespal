## Overview and object of the game

The 7th Citadel is a cooperative exploration and adventure board game, in which you play against the game and try to beat a Threat that looms over you. You may take on the challenge alone or in a team of 2, 3, or 4 adventurers.

### You win!

You win if you manage to overcome the Threat you chose to face.  
When this happens, it will be clearly stated by the game.

### You lose ...

You lose if one of the following occurs:

* All characters are unconscious (see "**[Unconsciousness](#unconsciousness)**").
* An in-game effect reads: "Your adventure ends here."

When you beat a Threat or your adventure ends prematurely, you must start a new adventure by playing the introductory scenario "**A new beginning**". Everything you gained and achieved during the previous adventure is lost.

### Rules summary

You are facing a threat - in the form of a Threat Booklet divided into scenarios - that will inevitably strike you (unless you die in the meantime!).

***Note:** This box contains an introductory scenario, and the "Dadachaem's awakening" and "Drums of desolation" Threat Booklets.*

You explore the world of the Collapsing Lands by resolving *Exploration* cards, putting into play numbered *Adventure* cards (*Terrain* and *Permanent event* cards) that gradually form the Board, and talking with the inhabitants of the Collapsing Lands (by means of the Dialogue Book).

During the game, you decide collectively which character will take an action from among those that can be seen on the *Terrain* card their figure is standing on, the *Permanent event* cards attached to that *Terrain* card, and their *Character*, *Skill*, *Purse* and *Quest item* cards.

In order to perform actions, you will use your personal Action Deck.

Every action works the same way. The active player, who chose to take the action, must go through the following steps in this order:

* Select which of their *Purse* cards they can and wish to use. Their effects include lowering the amount of energy the player must spend to perform the action and increasing chances of success.

* Spend energy, which is represented by the action's cost, by drawing cards from their Action Deck.

* Reveal any drawn cards, which are worth variable amounts of successes, and then compare their total number of successes with the action's difficulty (the more cards they drew, the more successes they should obtain, but the faster they are spending their energy).

* Apply the consequences of the action, which vary depending on whether it succeeded or failed.

Once the active player has finished an action, another turn begins:
One player (either the same or another one) takes another action.

***Note:** Certain actions - called "compound" actions - must be performed multiple times to be finished, but they essentially follow the same process (with a few minor differences, detailed later).*

When you no longer have (enough) cards in your Action Deck, you must perform a Recovery to shuffle cards from your Discard Pile back into your Action Deck. However, this causes you to lose life points (see "**[Recovery](#recovery)**").

When you run low on life points or you think you have achieved the goal(s) set by the scenario, it is time for you to return to the Citadel to discover the consequences of your actions!

Throughout the game, your group of adventurers will progress by accumulating hope, represented by specific cards, and trading it for precious bonuses on the *Destiny* page of the Citadel leaflet.

Unlike most board games, The 7th Citadel will give you the experience of a long-term adventure, while the easy saving system enables you to suspend your adventure at any time and resume it later on.

## Card types

### Character cards

A *Character* card represents the character you are playing and enables you to take the *move* action. It also acts as a reminder of the maximum number of *Skill* cards you may have in hand and the maximum weight you may carry. These values depend on player count.

1. *Character's name*
2. *Corresponding figure (in the character's color)*
3. *Available action and effect*
4. *Default maximum hand size and carried weight (depends on player count)*
5. *Unique ID number*

### Save cards

*Save* cards are used to save the game (see "**[Saving the game](#saving-the-game)**").

### Action cards

Each player has a personal Action Deck, made only of *Action* cards. These represent the life force you are spending when drawing them to pay the cost of your actions or when an in-game effect compels you to discard them. When in your hand, they represent your skills. These skills help you when you perform actions or enable you to take new actions.

1. *Card type* - Skill
2. *Title*
3. *Result area: Contains successes and class icons obtained during the Result step of an action*
4. *Effect(s) and/or available action*
5. *Unique ID number*

### Exploration cards

The cards with a "foggy" back are events that occur randomly as players explore the Collapsing Lands. They can be permanent events, temporary events, found items, etc. Each *Exploration* card belongs to an area, usually represented by a Roman numeral (**I**, **II**, etc.) on the back of the card and on the *Terrain* card it is attached to.

1. *Area*
2. *Placement arrows (one of them points towards the Terrain card that caused the Exploration card to be put into play)*
3. *Available action*
4. *Unique ID number (on the front only)*

***Note:** To prevent these cards from being identifiable, their unique ID numbers are located on their fronts (top right corner).*

### Adventure cards

Green or gold numbered cards contain the terrains you will discover as you explore, the predefined events you can trigger (places, encounters, etc.), items you can find and many more surprises to be discovered!

1. *Card number*
2. *Scenario-specific card (see "**[Take a numbered card](#take-a-numbered-card)**")*
3. *Informative flavor text*
4. *Effect(s)*
5. *Unique ID number*

***Adventure* cards include various types of cards:**

#### TERRAIN

*Terrain* cards are portions of the Collapsing Lands that form the Board. You may move your figure onto them and take actions from them.

1. *Available action(s)*
2. Exploration *card(s) to be put into play in the space indicated by the arrow*

#### PERMANENT EVENT

*Permanent event* cards are put into play on the Board after being revealed (see "**[Permanent event card](#permanent-event-card)**"). They are attached to the *Terrain* card in the direction their placement arrow points.

1. *Placement arrow (points towards the Terrain card the event is attached to)*
2. *Performed action that has caused the event to be put into play*
3. *Effect(s) and/or available action(s)*

#### TEMPORARY EVENT

*Temporary event* cards are resolved as soon as they are revealed, before being discarded (unless otherwise stated on the card) into a play area called "**The Past**", represented by a divider.

1. *Card type* - Temporary event
2. *Flavor text*
3. *Effect(s) and/or available action(s)*

#### GLOBAL EVENT

These cards are placed near the Board and do not leave play until an effect makes you discard them. Their effects apply to the entire Board as long as they are in play.

1. *Card type* - Global event
2. *Title*
3. *Effect(s) and/or available action(s)*

#### PURSE

These cards include items, companions, positive or negative states, etc., that you can gain during the adventure. They help you - or hinder you - when you perform actions, or enable you to take new actions. They are the only cards bearing one or more **KEYWORDS**.

1. *Card type* - Purse
2. *Weight*
3. *Title*
4. *Flavor text*
5. *Effect(s) and/or available action(s)*
6. *Keywords*

#### QUEST ITEM

These cards are common to all players and provide you with helpful information. In some cases, they enable you to benefit from positive effects or take new actions. They are stored behind (or on) the "**Quest items**" divider and the players may look at them freely. Unless told otherwise, you may not discard them.

1. *Card type* - Quest item
2. *Title*
3. *Effect(s) and/or available action(s)*

#### WORLD MAP

These cards must be inserted into a slot of the World Map (see "**[World Map](#world-map)**").

1. *Card type* - World Map
2. *Arrows showing where to place any future World Map cards*

## Sorting and storing game components

**Golden rule!** You may not look at the contents of the cards, Threat Booklets, and Dialogue Book until the game invites you to do so.

1. Behind the "**Characters**" divider, store the 4 *Character* cards.
2. Behind the "**Save**" divider, store the 8 *Save* cards.
3. Behind the "**Character Skills**" divider, store the 84 *Character Skill* (blue back Action cards) identified by a *Hand* icon on the front (top left corner) containing the character's initial **A**, **B**, **C**, **D** or the letter "**X**".
4. Behind the "**Advanced Skills**" divider, store the 76 *Advanced Skill* cards (blue back *Action* cards), identified by a *Hand and Laurel* icon.
5. Behind the "**Reflex Skills**" divider, store the 24 *Reflex Skill* cards (blue back Action cards), identified by a *Hand and Laurel + R* icon.
6. Store the *Exploration* cards, foggy side towards you, behind the dividers matching their respective areas (**#**, **I**, **II**, etc.).
7. Sort the *Adventure* cards - green or gold back - towards you,
in ascending order of their numbered backs and store them behind
the appropriate dividers (cards **000** to **049** behind divider
behind divider "**000**", **050** to **099** behind divider "**050**", etc.).

During the game, you will store:

* Any *Quest* cards behind (or on) the "**Quest items**" divider.
* Any discarded *Adventure* and *Exploration* cards behind (or on) the "**The Past**" divider.
* Any banished cards behind the "**Banished cards**" divider.

***Note:** As stated on the "**Quest items**" and "**The Past**" dividers, you may lay these dividers flat near the Board and place the applicable cards on them.*

**Golden rule!** Green *Adventure* cards must always be placed before any gold *Adventure* cards bearing the same number. Then, among the cards of the same color, any *Blank Flag* *Adventure* cards must always be placed before any *White Flag* *Adventure* cards bearing the same number.

***Note:** Some Adventure cards exist only with a gold back. Some Adventure cards with a Blank Flag have no alternative version with a White Flag.*

## Begin a new adventure

You will choose your character and their starting skills during the introductory scenario "**A new beginning**".

When you have finished reading the rules and are ready to begin a new adventure, open the introductory scenario's booklet to page **3** and read until the booklet tells you to stop.

## Overview

### WORLD MAP

The World Map shows what the world looked like during the golden age of the Kel Protectorate. It contains invaluable, though often outdated, information about important places. It can be updated through the insertion of *World Map* cards that you may obtain by making progress on the *Destiny* page of the Citadel leaflet.

### DIALOGUE BOOK

This contains the dialogues between your character(s) and the non-playing characters you may encounter (see "**[Read a dialogue](#read-a-dialogue)**").

### THREAT BOOKLETS AND BOOKMARK

Each Threat Booklet contains the scenarios related to the corresponding Threat. The bookmark indicates your current location in the Threat you are playing.

### CITADEL LEAFLET

This 8-page leaflet is where you record your group's progress (*Destiny* page), the buildings you may build or have built (*Buildings* page), the advancements in your side quests (*Side quests* page), and your scores/levels for multiple characteristics (*Community* page) (see "**[Players' progress and Citadel leaflet](#players-progress-and-citadel-leaflet)**").

### "BANISHED CARDS" AREA

All cards that are banished during the game must be stored behind this divider.

### "THE PAST" AREA

*Adventure* and *Exploration* cards that are discarded during the game must be stored behind (or on) this divider.

### ADVENTURE DECK

The Adventure Deck contains all numbered cards with a green or gold back.

### EXPLORATION DECK

The Exploration Deck contains random events sorted by area.

### THE BOARD

You build the Board as you put faceup *Terrain* and *Permanent event* cards and facedown (foggy side up) Exploration cards into play.

### QUEST ITEMS" AREA

All *Quest* cards that are obtained during the game must be stored behind (or on) this divider. You may look at them at all times.

### DISCARD PILE

Each player has their own Discard Pile that contains the *Action* cards, faceup, they have discarded during the game. The player may look through the cards in their Discard Pile at all times.

### ACTION DECK

Each player has their own Action Deck, where they draw cards to perform actions. They may not look at the cards in their Action Deck.

### CHARACTER CARD

This card is placed in front of the player playing that character. You will store your blocked cards underneath this card (see "**[Block / unblock a card](#block--unblock-a-card)**"), which you may look at freely. We recommend placing your Action Deck and Discard Pile on either side of this card.

### PURSE CARDS

Each player places their *Purse* cards in front of themselves (they have none when the game begins).  
*Tip: You can save space on the table by laying cards on top of one another, so that only their effects are visible.*

### HAND

Each player has a hand containing their Skill cards (they have none when the game begins).

### GLOBAL EVENT CARD

A card whose effect affects the entire Board.

## Turn sequence

### 1. Choose the active player and the action to be taken

Each turn, one player is collectively chosen to be the "active player". They choose the available action they wish to take.

This action will always be represented by an icon in a white square visible on one of the following:

* The *Terrain* card their figure is standing on.
* A *Permanent event* card attached to the *Terrain* card their figure is standing on.
* A *Temporary event* card that has just been revealed (this action is mandatory).
* One of their *Skill* cards they have in hand.
* One of their *Purse* cards.
* A *Quest Item* card.

### 2. Check for other involved characters

Each character whose figure is on the active player's *Terrain* card ...

* **May** get involved in the action if it is not mandatory and the active player agrees.
* **Must** get involved in the action if it is mandatory (see "**[Mandatory actions](#mandatory-actions)**").

Unless otherwise stated, only the active player may use *Skill* and/or *Purse* cards during the action and they may only use **their own cards**.

***Note:** Getting involved in another player's action may be helpful where some skills can be used to help the active player.*

### 3. Resolve the action

The active player resolves the 4 steps of the action: **Gear up**, **Draw**, **Result**, and **Consequence** (see "**[Action resolution steps](#action-resolution-steps)**").

### 4. Start a new turn

A new turn begins with a new active player being appointed. It may be the player from the previous turn, if all players agree. If you cannot reach an agreement, the player to the left of the last active player becomes the new active player.

## Action types

### Simple actions

Most actions in the game are "simple" actions that end immediately after the Consequence step.

### Group actions

An action with the *Stairs* icon may not be taken unless all conscious characters get involved.

### Forbidden actions

An action cannot be taken if:

* Another action is already being performed.
* It has a prerequisite that players cannot meet.
* It has the *Staircase* icon and not all conscious characters are involved in it.
* An icon for this action can be seen on a *Permanent event* card attached to the *Terrain* card showing the action - this means the action has already been performed and cannot be performed again on this *Terrain* card.

### Compound actions

"Compound" actions feature one or more rows, each with consequence sections for success and failure. The current action row is the one where a die lies on the icon representing the action's difficulty. A compound action is resolved over several turns. If it is mandatory, you must take it again right after resolving the Consequence step, and again until it is over. If it is not mandatory, you may choose to resume it later, when you decide to.

### Mandatory actions

A mandatory action has a red outline.

When it can be seen on a *Temporary event* card or in a dialogue *Balloon* all characters on the same *Terrain* card as the player who revealed it **must** get involved in the action. The involved characters choose which of them is the active player.

When it can be seen on a *Terrain* card, all characters on that terrain **must** get involved in the action, provided it can still be taken. The involved characters choose which of them is the active player.

## Resolving an action

All actions have:

* A *White Square* icon showing what action it is.

* A default cost *X+*, i.e. the minimum number of cards the active player must draw from their Action Deck to perform the action.

* A difficulty *X*, i.e. the minimum number of successes to obtain for the action to succeed.

* Consequences if the action succeeds *White Section* and, usually, consequences if the action fails *Black Section*.

Compound actions come with a slot for a die, showing the action's difficulty. When the active player takes the action, if there is no die on the card, they must place one in the *Star Die* slot on the first action row, making sure that its value matches the shown difficulty *X*. If no die is available, the active player must take one from another card.

The default cost of some actions is associated with a "chain" icon which caps the number of cards whose successes you may take into account (more information below).

## Action resolution steps

### 1. Gear up

**The active player selects, from among their *Purse* cards, those whose effects (some or all) they wish to apply. Each effect may be used only once during the action.**

A card may only be selected if it has a condition icon *Brown Square* that matches the taken action *White Square* **AND** no **KEYWORD** in common with another selected card.

**Golden rule!** When a *Brown Square with red outline* icon can be seen on one of the active player's *Purse* cards - or on a *Global Event* card - and the active player takes the corresponding action, they MUST select that card AND apply its effects.

#### Clarifications:

* You do not need to select the *Skill* cards whose effects you want to apply during the action.
* When the active player takes an action available on one of their *Purse* cards, that card is automatically selected.
* When "**[selected]**" can be read as part of an effect on a *Purse* card, you **must** apply the effect that follows if you have selected the card during the Gear up step of the action.
* An empty *Brown Square* icon on a card means the associated effect may be applied during any action.

### 2. Draw

**The active player determines the cost of the action and draws that many cards.**

#### A. Determine the cost of the action

Cost is shown in the blue diamond **X+**. It represents the number of cards the active player must draw (the energy they must spend) from their Action Deck to perform the action.

A **+X** effect increases the action's cost by **X**.

A **-X** effect reduces the action's cost by **X**.

The cost of an action may be 0. In cases where the cost is lowered below 0, consider it to be 0.

#### B. Draw Action cards

The active player draws a number of cards from the top of their Action Deck equal to the cost of the action, and places them face down in front of themselves. If they choose to, they may draw any number of additional cards from the top of their Action Deck to increase their chances of success. Any such additional cards are placed face down with those previously drawn.

If their Action Deck contains fewer cards than they should be drawing, the active player must immediately draw the remaining cards and perform a Recovery (see "**[Recovery](#recovery)**") - which does not end the action - and then continues to draw from the replenished deck enough cards to pay the action's cost, provided their character is still conscious.

### 3. Result

**The active player reveals the cards they drew, counts the obtained successes, and then compares the total with the action's difficulty.**

#### A. Reveal the cards

The active player reveals the cards they just drew (by flipping them face up).

#### B. Take successes into account

The active player may take into account any obtained successes visible in the result areas (left-hand strip) of the cards they just revealed.

They obtain:

* 1 success for each full star.
* 1 success for each pair of "half-stars" they manage to combine to construct a full star, provided the halves are oriented so when combined they form one complete star (i.e., one left half and one right half-star).

The active player is not compelled to take all obtained successes into account; they may even choose to ignore them all if they wish.

##### Important exception!

Some actions with a "chain" icon are less likely to succeed
without the appropriate skills and/or equipment.

The *Chain* icon means the active player may take into account the successes (stars and half-stars) in the result areas of **X** revealed cards at most (player's choice), where **X** is the action's default cost **X+**.

For example, if the action's default cost is **3+**, the active player may take into account the star and half-star icons in the result areas of no more than 3 revealed cards of their choice, regardless of how many they chose to draw. They must ignore any stars and half-stars shown on the other cards they have revealed.

This restriction only applies to the successes in the revealed cards' result areas.

#### C. Apply the effects of their cards

The active player may apply the effects of one or more of their cards (selected *Purse* cards, *Skill* cards from their hand, *Quest* cards, etc.) in order to get additional successes and/or take additional cards into account and/or convert class icons into various bonuses.

##### Get additional successes

Each *Star* icon is worth 1 additional success.

##### Take additional cards into account

When the action's cost has a *Chain* icon, the *Chain +Y* effect enables the active player to take into account the successes in the result area(s) of Y additional revealed card(s).

##### Convert class icons into various bonuses

Some effects enable the active player to convert into various bonuses the *Strength*, *Dexterity*, *Support* or *Arcane*, and *Wild* class icons shown in the result areas of the revealed cards, on the *Purse* cards they have selected, on the *Skill* cards in their hand, on their *Quest* cards, etc.

##### Clarifications:

* Even when the action's cost has a *Chain* icon, you may take every class icon in every revealed card's result area into account and apply the effect of every *Reflex Skill* card and every *Purse* card you selected.
* Each class icon obtained may be used only once, only by the active player, and for a single effect.
* When an effect comes with "**max. X**", the active player may apply that effect **X** times at most.
* The *Black Question* icon is "wild" - it may represent any of the following class icons: *Strength*, *Dexterity*, *Support* or *Arcane*.
* The *White Question* icon means you may "spend" any of the following icons to apply the shown effect: *Strength*, *Dexterity*, *Support* or *Arcane*.

#### D. Check the number of successes obtained against the action's difficulty

**Finally, the active player compares the successes they obtained with the action's difficulty.**

In a simple action, that is the number in a gold star, and in a compound action, it is the number in a gold star shown on the upper face of the die resting on the card.

**Simple action:** If the active player reaches or exceeds the number shown in the star, the action **succeeds**. Otherwise, the action **fails**.

**Compound action:** For each success taken into account, the active player reduces the die's value by 1. If the die's value would go below 1, the action **succeeds**. Otherwise, the action **fails**. When a compound action fails, the die keeps its new (reduced) value.

Clarifications:

* If the active player gets more successes than needed, any "excess" successes are lost.
* When a card is discarded, returned, or banished, any die resting on it is removed from it and returned to the game box.

***Note:** When a compound action succeeds, either the die is moved to another action row or the card is discarded. Most compound actions end with a success on the last action row.*

### 4. Consequence

**The active player applies the action's consequences and then discards all *Skill* cards revealed during the Result step.**

#### A. Apply the consequences

If the action:

* **Succeeds**, they must apply the effects shown in the white section.

* **Fails**, they must apply the effects shown in the black section. If there is no such section, failing this action has no consequence.

See [Consequences of actions](#consequences-of-actions-and-events-take-a-card).

#### B. Discard the revealed cards

Lastly, the active player discards all *Skill* cards revealed during the Result step. The *Take X Skill cards* effect means the active player may add up to **X** of these cards to their hand, instead of discarding them.

**Golden rule!** Unless explicitly stated otherwise (e.g. "each involved character ... ", "one involved character ... ", "one random involved character ... "), the consequence of an action applies ONLY to the active player.

## Consequences of actions and events: Take a card

**Golden rule!** Card text and dialogue text override this rulebook. When in doubt about a rule or in-game effect, interpret it in the most logical way to you or, if you cannot resolve the issue, the way most in your favor.

**The most frequent consequence you will apply is taking a card.**

### Take a numbered card

When taking a numbered card as a consequence of an action or event, the active player must take it from the Adventure Deck.

* IF MULTIPLE CARDS WITH THE SAME NUMBER ARE AVAILABLE:

The active player randomly takes one of the green cards (with exceptions - see "**Golden rule!**" below), reads the flavor text on the back, and reveals it.

***Note:** The flavor text on Adventure cards often contains helpful details. Be sure to read it carefully!*

**Golden rule!** Some *Adventure* cards are linked to a specific scenario - or card. You may not take them unless you are playing that scenario or possess that card.

When the back of an *Adventure* card shows a numbox associated with the *Flag* shape, it means there are possibly multiple versions of this card (bearing the same number) **AND** one of them is linked to a specific scenario - or card.

When the back of a card shows a pictograph inside a *White Flag* icon, if that pictograph corresponds to the scenario you are playing or matches a pictograph shown on another card in your possession - *Purse*, *Quest*, *World Map*, etc. - **you must take it as a priority**. Otherwise, you may not take it and you must take another card (bearing the same number) with the *Flag* shape.

* IF NO GREEN CARD IS AVAILABLE:

The active player must take a gold card instead.

**Golden rule!** A player may only take a gold card if there are no available green cards bearing the same number in the Adventure Deck.

* IF NO CARD WITH THAT NUMBER IS AVAILABLE:

When the numbox of the card you must take is followed by a circle icon, it means you need not do anything if the card is not available in the Adventure Deck. Otherwise, you must immediately **return** all the cards in the Past and then take the newly available card.

* IF SEVERAL INVOLVED PLAYERS NEED TO TAKE A NUMBERED CARD:

The active player takes their card first and resolves it before the next involved player in clockwise order does the same.

**Once the card has been taken and revealed, what you must do depends on the card:**

#### *Terrain* card

One involved character must put this card into play by placing it on the Board like in a jigsaw puzzle, making sure that it is oriented the same way as the other cards on the Board.

*Terrain* cards are generally put into play after an *Exploration* card has been resolved (see "**[Exploring the Collapsing Lands](#exploring-the-collapsing-lands)**").

***Note:** When you put a new Terrain card into play, you do not automatically move your figure onto it.*

#### *Permanent event* card

One involved character must put this card into play by placing it on the Board with its placement arrow pointing towards the *Terrain* card their figure is standing on, and with the card oriented the same way as the other cards on the Board.

This *Permanent event* card is now attached to the *Terrain* card towards which its placement arrow points, meaning that any actions and effects shown on the card are now available to any player whose figure is on the attached *Terrain* card.

**Golden rule!** The action icon in the placement arrow reminds you which action caused you to put the card into play. As long as this event is in play, that action may not be taken again from the Terrain card to which the event is attached.

#### *Temporary event* card

One involved character must immediately resolve this event and then discard the card into the Past, unless the card states otherwise (banish it, return it, etc.). If this card shows a mandatory action, all the characters on the *Terrain* card of the player who revealed it **must** get involved in that action - they choose which of them is the active player.

#### *Global event* card

One involved character must put this card into play near the Board, where it stays until an effect makes you discard, return, or banish it. Its effects apply to the entire Board as long as it is in play.

#### *Purse* card

One involved character may either keep this card by putting it into play in front of themselves, or discard it into the Past if it has no *Lock* icon (see "**[Purse cards and maximum carried weight](#purse-cards-and-maximum-carried-weight)**").

#### *Quest item* card

One involved character must store this card behind (or on) the "**Quest items**" divider. All players may look at it and/or use it.

### Take a card not directly summoned by a numbox

The players may have to take a card in the Adventure Deck without the card's number being shown in a numbox - for instance, when they find a hidden number (see "**[Spotting a hidden number](#spotting-a-hidden-number)**") or solve a riddle.

When this is the case, a "### Thumbs Up" icon must be visible on the back of the card you take, with "###" being the number of the card that enabled you to take it. If that icon is not visible, then you have taken the wrong card and must **return** it.

## Other consequences of actions and events

### Read a dialogue

The active player opens the Dialogue Book and goes to the indicated numbered paragraph. They read it - out loud if they wish - and apply any applicable effects (new paragraph to read, action to take, choice to make, etc.).

If a dialogue contains a mandatory action the involved players may freely choose which of them will be the active player for that action.

While reading a dialogue, you may not take an action shown on a card, unless the dialogue invites you to do so.

Quoted text in *italics* is dialogue spoken by non-playing characters. Quoted text in ***bold italics*** is dialogue spoken by the active player. Underlined text refers to a side quest.

When a word is followed by an asterisk ("*"), it means your character knows about it and you can read its definition on pages 2 and 3 of the Dialogue Book's Glossary.

### Add Skill cards to your hand

The *Take X Skill cards* effect allows the active player to add up to X Skill cards drawn and revealed during the Result step to their hand.

### Discard a card

When an in-game effect instructs you to discard a card, the active player must immediately put that card into their Discard Pile if it is an *Action* card (blue back), or into the Past if it is either an *Adventure* card (green or gold back) or an *Exploration* card (foggy back). The cards in the Past may not be looked at, unless an in-game effect allows you to.

The *-X Cards* effect means the active player must discard the top **X** cards of their Action Deck. If you must discard more cards than your Action Deck contains, you must immediately perform a Recovery (see "**[Recovery](#recovery)**").

### Banish a card

When an in-game effect instructs you to **banish** a card, the active player must immediately remove that card from play permanently by storing it behind the "**Banished cards**" divider in the box. All banished cards may not be looked at, unless an in-game effect allows you to. They will be returned to their original decks as soon as the players vanquish the Threat (or lose).

### Return a card

When an in-game effect instructs you to **return** a card, the active player must immediately put that card back in its place in its original deck.

### Block / unblock a card

When an in-game effect instructs you to **block** a card, the affected player must immediately slip it underneath their *Character* card. A blocked card may be looked at at all times. However, as long as it is  blocked, it has no effect and may not be used. If it is a *Purse* card, its weight must still be taken into account and you may discard it if you wish to. If it is a *Skill* or *Quest* card, you may not discard it.

When an in-game effect allows you to **unblock** a card, take it from under your *Character* card, then either shuffle it back into your Action Deck if it is a *Skill* card, or put it into play in front of yourself if it is one of your *Purse* cards.

### Gain / lose life points

The affected player increases or decreases the value on their life point counter by the indicated amount (see "**[Life points](#life-points)**").

### Suffer damage

The *Blood X* effect means you lose **X** life points.

The *Shield X* effect cancels *Blood X*, but it cannot prevent damage taken from an in-game effect reading "You lose X life points".

### Move the die to another row (compound action only)

The *Move Die Down* effect means you need to move the die to the next row, and in some cases skip one or more rows in the process.

The active player places the die on the appropriate slot of the new row, making sure its value matches the shown difficulty *Star X*.

### Increase your community scores

The following in-game effects enable players to increase (**+X**) or decrease (**-X**), by the indicated amount, the Influence **+X/-X**, Knowledge **+X/-X**, Production **+X/-X**, or Defense **+X/-X** scores on the *Community* page of the Citadel leaflet (see "**[Players' progress and Citadel leaflet](#players-progress-and-citadel-leaflet)**"). None of these scores may ever go below 0 or above 25.

## Skill cards and hand size

### Skill cards

Your *Skill* cards help you when you perform actions or enable you to take new actions.

They exist in 3 types:

* **Character Skills:** These are the skills that characters begin the adventure with. Their effects can only be applied from a player's hand.

* **Advanced Skills:** These are cards that players may gain during the adventure (see "**[Destiny page](#destiny-page)**"). Their effects can only be applied from a player's hand.

* **Reflex Skills:** These are gained just like Advanced Skills, but their effect is only applied when they are revealed during the Result step.

Most effects on *Skill* cards imply discarding them or blocking them. When this is not the case, their effect applies as long as you have them in hand.

### Hand size

Unless otherwise stated, the maximum number of *Skill* cards you may have in hand is shown on your *Character* card and depends on player count. At any time - except during an action you are involved in - if you have more *Skill* cards in hand than your allowed hand size, you must discard any excess cards of your choice.

### Take an action / apply an effect

You may take an action visible on one of your *Skill* cards.

When you are the active player, you may apply some or all of the effects shown on the *Skill* cards you have in hand, provided the condition associated with the effect(s) matches the action being performed.

### Discard / give

You may discard *Skill*  cards from your hand into your Discard Pile at any time.

You may not give any of your *Skill* cards to another player.

## Purse cards and maximum carried weight

### Purse cards

Your *Purse* cards help you when you perform actions or enable you to take new actions.

They usually have one or more KEYWORDS that limit the number of these cards that may be selected during an action - you may not select (in order to apply their effects) more than one *Purse* card which has a given KEYWORD.

### (Maximum) Carried weight

The maximum weight you are allowed to carry can be found on your *Character* card and depends on player count.

Your carried weight is the total weight of your *Purse* cards, including your blocked cards. It may exceed your maximum carried weight; however, as long as this is the case, you may not take the *move* action on your *Character* card.

### Take an action / apply an effect

You may take an action visible on one of your *Purse* cards.

When you are the active player, you may apply some or all of the effects shown on the *Purse* cards you choose to select (during the Gear up step of an action), provided the condition associated with the effect(s) matches the action being performed.

Reminder! You may not select multiple *Purse* cards with the same KEYWORD.

### Discard / give

You may freely discard your *Purse* cards, even if they are blocked, as long as they do not have a *Lock* icon.

**Golden rule!** A player may not decide to discard *Locked Purse* card or give it to another player.

A character may give a *Purse* card to another character as long as they are both on the same *Terrain* card and not performing an action.

When this happens, the player who gives **OR** the one who receives the *Purse* card must discard the top X cards of their Action Deck, where X is equal to the weight of the item being given.

You may give one of your blocked *Purse* cards (unless it has a *Lock* icon), but it remains blocked.

## Life points, Unconsciousness, and Recovery

### Life points

Every time you begin a new scenario, the Threat Booklet tells you how many life points each character receives and must indicate on their life point counter (this amount varies based on player count).

During the adventure, when gaining or losing life points, you will adjust your life point counter accordingly.

You may exceed your initial number of life points (defined by the scenario), but you may never have more than 99 life points.

When you drop to 0 life points (or below), your counter is set to 0 and you fall unconscious.

### Unconsciousness

When you become unconscious (0 life points), you must immediately:

* **Remove** your figure from the Board.

* **Return** all of your cards with the keyword **TEMPORARY**.

* **Discard** all *Skill* cards you have in hand.

* **Shuffle** all the cards in your Discard Pile back into your Action Deck.

* **Draw** 3 cards from your Action Deck to form your hand, and then banish 1 of these cards of your choosing. *You will be able to use these cards once you regain consciousness.*

If all characters are unconscious, the adventure ends immediately and the players lose.

If every character involved in an action shown on a *Temporary* card falls unconscious, that card is returned.

When an unconscious character regains consciousness, they put their figure back into play on the active player's *Terrain* card. This happens thanks to in-game effects or, in the worst case, when players are at the Citadel.

### Recovery

Your Action Deck represents your life force. When it becomes (nearly) depleted, it is time for you to perform a Recovery.

At any time, you may perform a Recovery to shuffle cards from your Discard Pile back into your Action Deck (even if the latter still contains cards).

To perform a Recovery, you must **lose 1 life point** for **each 2 cards** you choose to **randomly** take in your Discard Pile and shuffle back into your Action Deck.

You may not choose to lose more life points than you have in order to recover more cards.

**Example:** Ludovic wants to perform a Recovery in order to shuffle 8 random cards from his Discard Pile back into his Action Deck. To do this, he loses 4 life points.

**When you must draw or discard more cards than your Action Deck contains:**

* Draw or discard whatever cards remain in your Action Deck.
* Perform a Recovery.
* Draw or discard the remaining cards you were unable to draw or discard before.

#### Variants

**"Story" mode** (for adventurers who value storytelling more than survival)

To perform a Recovery, you must **lose 1 life point** for **each 3 cards** you choose to **randomly** take in your Discard Pile and shuffle back into your Action Deck.

**"Survival" mode** *(for adventurers with taste for a challenge)*

To perform a Recovery, you must lose **2 life points** for **each 3 cards** you choose to **randomly** take in your Discard Pile and shuffle back into your Action Deck.

## Exploring the Collapsing Lands

### Opening the space occupied by an Exploration card

An *Exploration* card is a random event that hides a portion of the Collapsing Lands. You need to resolve an *Exploration* card in order to remove it and put into play the *Adventure* card (generally a *Terrain* card) that belongs there. This is how you explore the Collapsing Lands.

Once the *Exploration* card has been resolved and removed from the Board, the active player must put an *Adventure* card into play right where the *Exploration* card used to be. The number of this *Adventure* card is shown in the numbox associated with the arrow on the *Terrain* card that points towards the newly opened space.

If that *Adventure* card is a *Terrain* card, the active player must make sure that it fits with each adjacent *Terrain* card like in a jigsaw puzzle, and then put the new *Exploration* cards into play (foggy side up) in each free adjacent space to which an arrow on the new *Terrain* card is pointing. Each of these new *Exploration* cards must carry the same pictograph - usually a Roman numeral - as the one in the arrow that points to its space and that caused it to be put into play.

If you must put an *Exploration* card into play and it is not available, you must immediately **return** all the cards in the Past and then take one of the newly available cards.

***Note:** An Exploration card may be a permanent event, a temporary event, etc. If it is a permanent event, the card remains in play (making it impossible to discover the terrain it hides) until it is resolved.*

### Not enough room to put a card into play

When there is not enough space on the table to put a card into play, all characters must take actions to meet on the same *Terrain* card. Then, players must return the *Terrain* cards of their choice - except the one containing their figures - along with the *Permanent event* cards attached to them, making sure that all remaining *Terrain* cards are reachable. If applicable, you must put a new *Exploration* card into play in every adjacent empty space towards which an arrow on a *Terrain* card points.

### Moving a figure on the Board

To move your figure on the Board, you must (with exceptions) take the *move* action shown on your *Character* card, which allows you to move your (and only your) figure to an adjacent *Terrain* card, provided your carried weight does not exceed your maximum carried weight.

Other effects you will discover as you play (skill, event, etc.) may move figures.

Some cards refer to the cardinal points: north, south, east, and west. In this regard, assume card text and icons are oriented to be read from west to east.

***Note:** It may happen that some permanent events (cliff, bottomless pit, etc.), showing several placement arrows, separate two Terrain cards. In this case, these events feature an action whose consequence is to move the figure to the Terrain card on the other side of the obstacle.*

**Reminder!** If a mandatory action can be seen on a *Terrain* card, players whose figures arrive onto that *Terrain* card must immediately take it collectively, unless it can no longer be taken.

### Spotting a hidden number

Some cards - *Terrain*, *Permanent event*, *Temporary event*, *Purse*, etc. - may contain hidden numbers. When you spot one, you may take the card bearing that number and then, after making sure it is the right card, discard the card on which you spotted the hidden number, and replace it with the new one.

When a hidden number can be seen on a *Terrain* card, or on a *Permanent event* card attached to it, you may not take the corresponding card unless you are on that terrain.

***Note:** A hidden number is always made of 3 digits. On the back of the card matching the hidden number, you should see the number of the card on which you spotted it. If that icon is not there, or if it does not match the number of the card where you spotted the hidden number, then you must have taken the wrong card and must return it.*

## Threat Booklets, scenarios, and bookmark

Threat Booklets are divided into scenarios and narrate the story that players live as they travel through the Collapsing Lands.

Each scenario sets one or more goals that players must reach. At the end of each scenario, you read its epilogue. This happens once you are back at the Citadel (unless clearly stated otherwise by the scenario), usually because the characters run low on life points (and prefer returning before all falling unconscious) or have achieved their goals.

The Threat Booklet then details the consequences of your actions, which vary based on your choices and your performance during the scenario (whether you reached your goals or not). The booklet then guides you to a new scenario, and so on until the final confrontation against the Threat you have chosen to face.

The position of the bookmark in the Threat Booklet is defined by the scenario and reminds you which scenario you are playing.

***Note:** There are several ways to go back to the Citadel. The most common one is by moving the characters' figures along the Terrain cards that lead back to the Citadel, and then resolving the permanent event that enables you to end the current scenario.*

## Players' progress and Citadel leaflet

**The Citadel leaflet is shared by all players. It consists of several pages that track your group's progress through the adventure, among other things.**

### PLAYER AID PAGE

This page contains a reminder of the main action consequences and a description of creature traits.

Some creatures you will fight during the adventure have generic abilities called "traits":

When performing the *fight* action, you must apply the effect of each trait displayed next to the action. The effect of each creature trait is detailed on this player aid.

### BUILDINGS PAGES

This is where players construct buildings by checking boxes on the buildings of their choice. When a building has all of its boxes checked, it is considered to be "built" and its effect may be applied.

### COMMUNITY PAGE

On this page you can write down the names of the players taking part in the adventure and record each character's life point total when you end a scenario or save the game. You can sketch your community's coat of arms here.

This page is also where you keep track of:

* The level of your groundshiver (an artifact you begin every scenario with, except for the introductory scenario "**A new beginning**"). That level is given by the scenario, and enables you to reduce the amount of energy you spend to explore the Collapsing Lands.
* Your Influence, Knowledge, Defense, and Production scores, in the form of tracks extending from 1 to 25.

These scores may fluctuate up or down throughout your adventure, and may be taken into account for certain in-game effects, and at the end of scenarios, to measure how well you completed your goals. You may not reduce a score to less than 0 or increase it to more than 25. If the prerequisite of an in- game effect requires you to reduce a score to less than 0, you may not apply that effect. If a score must be increased to more than 25, set it to 25.

**Production:** Represents the community's capacity to produce food.

**Defense:** Represents the community's capacity to defend itself and secure the surrounding territories.

**Influence:** Represents the relationships between the community and the other inhabitants and institutions of the Collapsing Lands.

**Knowledge:** Represents the knowledge, information and rumors the community holds.

### DESTINY PAGE

During the game, you gain "**Hope reborn!**" *Quest* cards that you can "spend" (these cards will let you know how) to check symbols on this page, granting you helpful bonuses. These bonuses are detailed on the *Destiny* page and enable you to gain new *Skill* cards, construct helpful buildings, etc.

### MAP OF THE KEL PROTECTORATE PAGES

The map of the Old World, which you may annotate.

### SIDE QUESTS PAGE

This is where you list all the side quests obtained during the adventure. Each side quest may only appear here once.

**Tip:** Many side quests can be obtained at the tavern, a building you can build on the *Buildings* page of the Citadel leaflet.

A side quest generally invites you to write down its title and the dialogue (from the Dialogue Book) that caused you to obtain the quest. You may freely reread that dialogue to be reminded of the context and goal(s) of the quest.

You may use the "notes" section to record information that might help you complete the quest, such as the name of a place or character.

When you add a side quest to the *Side quests* page of the Citadel leaflet, it is active (but not necessarily **initiated** yet).

When a quest becomes "**initiated**" - which will be explicitly instructed by an in-game effect - it means you have made a step towards its completion. Some side quests do not need that status to reach completion.

When a quest is marked as "**finished**" - which it becomes through an explicit in-game effect - it is no longer active: Ignore any in-game effects that concern it.

**Reminder!** Underlined text on a card or dialogue refers to a side quest.

*Note: Some side quests cannot be finished unless you are at the Citadel.*

## Saving and resuming the game

### Saving the game

**You may save the game only once during each scenario.**

You may save the game at any time as long as the bookmark is in the Threat Booklet, all conscious characters are on the same *Terrain* card, and no player is:

* Reading a dialogue in the Dialogue Book.
* Performing an action.
* Compelled to take a mandatory action.

**When you save the game:**

1. Each player discards all of their *Skill* cards.
2. Discard all the cards on the Board into the Past, except for the *Global event* cards that are in play, and the *Terrain* card all characters' figures are standing on.
3. Stack the remaining cards in the following order (from the top down) and put them behind the "**Save**" divider in the game box:
   * The *Terrain* card where the figures were standing, and the *Global event* cards.
   * For each player, their:
     * *Character* card with their blocked cards underneath it.
     * *Save - Action Deck* card, with all the cards in their Action Deck underneath it,
     * *Save - Discard Pile* card, with all the cards in their Discard Pile underneath it,
     **Purse* cards.
4. Each player stores their life point counter in the box as a record of the number of life points they had when the game was saved (it is also recommended to replicate that number on the *Community* page of the Citadel leaflet).

### Resuming the game

When you resume a game after suspending it:

1. **Return** all the cards in the Past (*Adventure* and *Exploration*)
2. Put the *Global event* cards and the saved *Terrain* card back into play. Place the figures of all **conscious** characters onto the latter and put one *Exploration* card into play in front of each arrow shown on it.

Then, each player puts back into play their:

1. *Character* card with their blocked cards underneath.
2. Action Deck (and returns their *Save - Action Deck* card).
3. Discard Pile (and returns their *Save - Discard Pile* card).
4. *Purse* cards.

**Reminder!** the position of the bookmark in the Threat Booklet reminds you which scenario you are playing. Leave it there!

***Note:** Between two sessions, all and cards in the Past are stored behind their respective dividers.*

## Leaving or joining the adventure partway through

### Leaving the adventure partway through

When a character leaves the adventure permanently, the player **returns** their figure, their *Character* card, their *Character Skill* cards (bearing the character's initial or the letter "X") that were blocked underneath it and those they have in hand, the cards in their Action Deck and their Discard Pile, and finally their *Locked Purse* cards.

They must give their *Advanced Skill* and *Reflex Skill* cards to the other players, who discard them. They also give them their (blocked or not) *Purse* cards without the *Lock* icon, and the *Quest* cards that were blocked underneath their *Character* card. Any blocked *Purse* and *Quest* cards remain blocked.

Before they put their life point counter away, their life points are divided equally among the remaining conscious characters.

### Joining the adventure partway through

A player can easily join the adventure, or continue it with a new character if their previous character has left the adventure. They may only do so before a new scenario begins, when the players are at the Citadel.

To do so, they choose a character and form their Action Deck as explained on pages 5 to 7 of the introductory scenario.

## Easily forgotten golden rules

1. Any *Adventure* card whose numbox (on the back) is associated with a *White Flag* icon is linked to a specific scenario or card. You must take it over any other if the pictograph inside the *Flag* icon matches that of the scenario you are playing, or can be seen on another card you possess. Otherwise, you may not take it and you must take another card (bearing the same number) with the *Blank Flag* shape.

2. When an action is mandatory, all characters on the same *Terrain* card as the player who revealed it **must** get involved in the action. The involved characters choose which of them is the active player.

3. During the Gear up step of an action, the active player may not select multiple *Purse* cards that have a KEYWORD in common.

4. During the Draw step of an action, the active player may choose to draw **MORE** cards than the number (X+ default cost) shown on the action.

5. Any Star, Question, *Strength*, *Dexterity*, *Support*, *Arcane* icons **in the result area** of *Skill* cards are only ever taken into account when they are revealed from the active player's Action Deck during the Result step of an action.

6. The *Chain* icon on certain actions limits only the number of cards whose successes you may take into account. It does not forbid you to draw more cards or to take class icons on every drawn card into account.

7. When a character gives a *Purse* card to another character on their *Terrain* card, one of them must discard X cards, where X is equal to the weight of the item being given.
