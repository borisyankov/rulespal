# Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of the West Rulebook

## Table of Contents

It’s the late 19th century and America is booming. New train companies compete to satisfy the needs of a growing population. Merchants, officials, food, and goods need to travel from one place to another. An intricate network of train lines has appeared.

Thaddeus Reeves was one of the young entrepreneurs dreaming of connecting the entire nation and succeeded beyond his wildest dreams. Reeves Rails quickly established lucrative train routes from the Atlantic to the Mississippi and the company’s future is bright. But greedy rail barons are looking at Thaddeus’ growing rail empire and thinking about how they can take it away.

As the years have rolled along, Reeves Rails has continued to grow and thrive. Your new train company is ready to take part in this remarkable industry. Possibility and fortune shimmer off the paint of your newly purchased steam engines and this new express network should make all the difference.

Satisfied, you open the newspaper and read the headlines from out west...

## THE CAMPAIGN EXPERIENCE

### OVERVIEW

This **Ticket to Ride** game is a legacy-style game,meaning some of the results of a game carry forward to future games. If you have played a legacy game before, much of this section will be familiar. If you have not played one,read on, because this game is different from most board games you have played.

Over the course of 12  games, you will make permanent changes to your version of the game. You will add new rules, new materials, new pieces to the board, and so on. Many of the things you will find are hidden at the start of the game. Do not open any materials (other than the starting materials) until you are told.

Each game will have a  beginning, middle, and end. After tallying up scores, you will make changes to your game based on what happened in the game you just played. After that,the pieces and cards will go back in the box and the game will be put away like most other games.

However, when you start the next game, there will be parts that pick up where you left off: new rules remain in place, new cards will be added. There will be more parts to the game board.

Do not worry, we will guide you through it.

It is possible, even likely, that you will forget a new rule or misplay something in this game. That’s OK. If it’s easy to correct, correct it. If not, just remember it’s a game and move on.

#### Important note

The box contains a deck of story cards. Do not read these story cards until you are asked to and do not shuffle the deck. If these cards have, for any reason, been scattered, ask someone who is not playing the campaign to put back the cards in order, the A side facing up (1865- 01A, 1865-02A, ...).

### STORING AND RETIRING CARDS

The campaign box is divided into six parts using dividers to store the different components:

* **Train cards** where the train deck is stored between games.
* **Tickets** where the ticket deck is stored between games.
* **Events** where the event deck is stored between games.
* **Store room** where all other cards and components used every game are stored.
* **The post office** where undiscovered postcards are stored. Do not look at them until you are told.
* **The dead letter office** where retired cards are placed.

### RETIRING

You will be told to retire components of this game during play. This means that these components are no longer needed. Put retired cards in the dead letter office at the back of the campaign box. Return other retired components to the box. Most of the time you will not need them again but some might be called back as you play.

### POSTCARDS

Some tickets have an entry number on them, directing you to read a  postcard. Exactly when will be explained later.

### COMPANIES

Each player plays the president of a rail company and your goal is to grow your company, game after game, until you have the most successful company in North America. Each company has a special box with two compartments: the **office** and the **vault**. The office is where you keep cards and tokens in between games. At the start of each game,take all materials out of the office and make them part of your setup. The other compartment,the vault, is sealed shut, with a slit in the top of it. Materials put into the vault do not come out until the end of the campaign (12 games) and will determine which company was the most successful over the campaign. The more you have in your vault, the better your score at the end.

### THE STORY DECK

The story deck will guide you through the different games. At the start of each game, during step 7 of setup, draw the top card of the story deck, turn it over, and read it. Keep reading the story deck until you get to a **PAUSE** or **STOP** card, which tells you there are no more cards to read for the time being. **Make sure you read both sides of each card.** After reading a card (both sides!), you may retire it to the dead letter office, unless it goes into play, such as a new event card (see below).

### EVENTS

The game starts with 7 event cards, which form a deck. A new event comes into effect when a newspaper is drawn from the train deck. As you play and discover more of the world, new events will be added to the deck while old ones will be retired. When you find new events, read them before adding them to the event deck.

### DOLLARS

You control a company and your goal is to earn as much money (dollars) as possible, both in each game and over the course of the campaign. At the end of each game, whoever has the most money wins the game. Players must keep the dollar coins they have visible during the game.

### THE HIDDEN MATERIALS

The game has different materials that are hidden away at the start of the campaign. During play, you will bring them into the game, integrating them into the materials you are using.

The hidden materials are:

#### Frontier Boards

At the start of the campaign, you will play only the eastern part of Northern America. As you build your companies and rail lines, you will add new frontier boards to the existing board. These boards become part of your game board for all future games.

#### Frontier Boxes

There are 8 frontier boxes and a conductor's toolbox that contain mystery items. You will be instructed when to open them. When you do open a frontier box, all players can examine and read everything. There is nothing secret in there (once you open it).

#### Postcards

You will be instructed to draw postcards at various times. When you draw a postcard, read one side out loud (the postcard tells you which side) and keep the other side private until its conditions are met.

When you meet the conditions on a postcard, show all players the condition and then collect the benefit for the postcard.

New postcards drawn at the end of a game cannot be completed until a future game. Postcards drawn at the end of the 12th game cannot be completed.

### NEW RULES

There are empty boxes in this rulebook. As you play, when you discover new rules, add the rules stickers to the appropriate boxes in this book. Some rules will stay in effect for the rest of the campaign while others may stay in effect for only a few games.

### MYSTERIES AWAIT

There are pickaxe and skull symbols on some of the train cards. There are also colored bands on each ticket (and narrative text on some tickets). You can ignore these for now.

As you play, you will find postcards that mention rules, event cards, and locations you have not found yet. You have not missed anything. You just have not discovered that part of the world yet.

### BEFORE YOUR FIRST GAME

**Read this entire rulebook before setting up the first game.** Even if you are a seasoned Ticket to Ride player, some rules may have changed from other editions.

Separate the newspapers from the other train cards.

Each player chooses a company that they will play for the entire campaign. Take the company box of your color and write your name on it.

Put each company bonus card from the store room into its matching company box office (the front of the company box). Take the caboose card from the store room and randomly assign it to one of the players.

Once you have finished reading all the rules, start setting up, going to the story deck when told (during step 7).

## SETTING UP EACH GAME

1. Assemble the game board on the table. At the start of the campaign, the board is made out of 5 pieces. As you play and expand the board, the number of pieces that make up the board will grow.

2. Each player takes their company box and empties out the office (but not their vault!). At the start of the first game, there will be one card in your office (the company bonus card).

3. Give each player $5 in coins.

4. Shuffle newspapers into the train deck depending on the number of players:

   * 2 players: 6 newspapers
   * 3 players: 4 newspapers
   * 4-5 players: 3 newspapers

   Put any remaining newspapers in the store room.

5. Shuffle the train cards and deal a starting hand of **4 train cards** to each player.Place the remaining deck of train cards near the board, then turn the top five cards from the deck faceup. Any newspapers dealt to players or displayed among the five faceup cards must be reshuffled into the train deck and replaced with a new card. If three of the five faceup cards are locomotives, all five cards are immediately discarded and five new ones are turned faceup to replace them.

6. Shuffle the tickets and deal **4 tickets** to each player. Place the remainder in a deck facedown, in the ticket space on the board. After looking at them, each player must keep a minimum of 2 tickets although they may keep more. Place any returned cards on the bottom of the ticket deck.

   In the rare case that there are not enough tickets to deal 4 to each player, deal out enough so that each player has the same amount (2 or 3). In this case, all players must keep at least 1 ticket.

7. Read out the story deck until you get to a **PAUSE** card. Make sure to read both sides of the cards.

8. Shuffle the event cards and put them in a deck, facedown onto the space reserved for them on the board. The event discard space starts empty (the game starts without a current event).

9. Look at the back of your company box to see how many plastic trains of your color to use for that game. In the first game, this will be 20 trains but as you play more games, it will go up. Return all unused plastic trains to the box (they won't be used in this game).

10. > Rule A

11. > Rule B

12. > Rule C

13. > Rule D

14. The player with the caboose card goes first. If that player is not in the game, take the caboose card from their office, randomly choose a start player and give them that card.

15. > Rule E

## OBJECT OF THE GAME

The object of the game is to have the most money.

Money is gained by:

* Successfully completing a continuous path of routes between two cities listed on kept tickets
* Claiming routes of your own color
* Performing certain event actions
* Using up your plastic trains

Money is lost by players for each of their tickets they do not successfully complete by the end of the game.

As you play, you will find additional ways to earn and lose money.

## THE GAME TURN

The player with the caboose card goes first. Play then proceeds clockwise around the table, each player taking one turn until the game ends. On your turn, you must perform one (and only one) of the following three actions:

* **Draw train cards**
* **Claim a route**  
*(**Note:** unlike other Ticket to Ride games, you do not score anything when you claim a route.)*
* Draw tickets

### DRAW TRAIN CARDS

There are 6 colors of train cards, locomotives that act as wild cards (see below) and newspapers in the train deck. The colors of each type of train card match various routes between cities on the board: black, blue, white, green, yellow, and red.

If you choose to draw train cards, you may draw two cards. Either of these cards can be drawn from the five faceup cards next to the board or from the top of the deck (blind draw). After drawing a faceup card, the player must immediately replace it with a new card taken from the top of the train deck.

**If, at any time, three of the five faceup train cards are locomotives, all five cards are immediately discarded, and five new cards are turned faceup, one by one, to replace them.**

You may have any number of cards in your hand at any time. When the train deck is exhausted, all discarded train cards (including newspapers) are reshuffled into a new deck. The cards should be shuffled thoroughly, since most of the cards have been discarded in sets.

***Note:** In the unlikely event that there are 8 or fewer cards in the deck and discard pile combined (because players are hoarding many cards in their hands), you cannot decide to draw train cards. Instead you may only claim a route or draw tickets that turn.*

#### Drawing Locomotives

If you want to draw a faceup locomotive, it must be the first train card you draw this turn and you cannot draw a second one.

***Note:** If you are lucky enough to get a locomotive from the top of the deck in a blind draw, it still counts as a single card and you may still draw a total of two cards that turn.*

#### Using Locomotives

Locomotives are multi-colored and act as a wild card that can be part of any set of cards when claiming a route.

Sometimes you may also discard an extra locomotive to satisfy some postcards, events, and conditions. If you wish to satisfy multiple conditions, you must discard one locomotive for each one of them.

For example, if you have a postcard that reads **"When claiming a route, you may discard 1 extra locomotive to collect $5"** and one that reads **"When claiming a route, you may discard 1 extra locomotive to draw 2 train cards."** then you have to discard two extra locomotives to both draw 2 train cards and collect $5.

#### Newspapers

Each time you draw a newspaper from the deck (whether it is a blind draw or for a replacement):

* Turn the next card from the event deck faceup onto the event discard pile to immediately become the current event.
* Discard the newspaper and draw a replacement train card.

Many events are ongoing. Their effect is in play as long as it is the current event (the top card of the event discard pile). Events marked with a lightning bolt take effect immediately and have no further effect (they stay on top of the discard pile and are not replaced).

In some cases, the current event will be retired. When this happens, immediately draw a replacement event.

### CLAIM A ROUTE

A route is a set of continuous colored spaces (in some instances, gray spaces) between two adjacent cities on the map.

To claim a route, play a set of train cards equal to the number of spaces in the route. The set of cards played must match the color of the route. Gray routes can be claimed using a set of cards of any one color.

Remember that locomotives act as wild cards and may be part of a set of train cards of any color.

When you claim a route, place one of your plastic trains in each of the spaces of the route, then discard the cards used to claim the route.

You can only claim a route if there is a city at both ends of the route (routes that go off the edge of the board cannot be claimed).

You may claim any open route on the board. You are not required to connect to any of your previously claimed routes. You may only claim one route on your turn. A route must be claimed in its entirety during a single turn. For example, you cannot lay two plastic trains on a three-space route and wait for the next turn to lay the third plastic train.

#### Double Routes and Triple Routes

Some cities are connected by double or triple routes (two or three routes of the same length connecting the same cities).

A single player cannot claim more than one route of a double or triple route.

#### Important note

*In 2 and 3-player games, only one route of the double route between two cities is available for use: once a player has claimed one of these, the other route forming the double route is locked and unavailable to other players. **The three routes of a triple route are always available regardless of the number of players.***

#### Additional Rules for Claiming Routes

When a route is claimed, you might have other rules to follow. At the start of the campaign, there are two (listed below). As you play, you will discover new rules for claiming a route.

**When claiming a route, follow these rules, in order, skipping over any rules you do not qualify for (or that have not been found yet!).**

> Rule F

> Rule G

> Rule H

> Rule I

> Rule J

### COMPANY ROUTES

If you claim a route (of any length) that matches your company color, immediately take the bonus shown on your company bonus card.

> Rule K

> Rule L

> Rule M

> Rule N

> Rule O

> Rule P

> Rule Q

> Rule R

> Rule S

> Rule T

> Rule U

> Rule V

### CLAIMING A ROUTE INTO A LARGE CITY

When you claim a route that connects to at least one large city, draw the top card from the train deck to add to your hand. If you connect two large cities, you still only get one card. If you connect to the same city on different turns, you get a card each turn you connect to it.

### DRAW TICKETS

You can use your turn to draw more tickets. To do so, draw three tickets from the top of the ticket deck. If there are fewer than three tickets left in the deck, only draw the ones that are available.

You must keep at least one of the tickets drawn but may also keep two or all three if you choose. Any returned tickets are placed on the bottom of the ticket deck. Tickets drawn and not immediately discarded must be kept until the end of the game. They cannot be discarded during a later ticket draw.

The cities listed on a ticket represent travel goals. If, by the end of the game, you have created a continuous path of plastic trains in your color between the two cities named on a ticket you hold, you gain the dollars indicated. If you have failed to complete a continuous path between those cities, you lose the dollars indicated. Some tickets also have narrative text on them. You can ignore this text at the start of the first game (it will be explained as you play).

Unless you are told otherwise, keep your tickets secret from the other players until the end of the game. A player may have any number of tickets during the game.

## GAME END

When one player's stock of plastic trains is reduced to only 0, 1, or 2 at the end of their turn, each player, **including that player**, gets one final turn. The game then ends.

Rule W

### 1. Determine the Winner

Each player takes a bank slip, writes down the year of the game, and fills in the following lines:

#### Coins in Hand

Each player writes down the value of their coins in hand on the line shown on the bank slip.

#### Bonus for Trains Remaining

Each player counts the number of plastic trains left in their personal stock and writes down the bonus dollars as follows:

> Rule X

> Rule Y

### TOTAL BANK SLIPS

Players add everything up and write the total on their bank slips. The total on a bank slip can never be lower than $0.

The player with the most dollars wins the game. **Do not clean up the game yet.**

#### Tiebreaker Rules

*If two or more players are tied for any place, the one amongst them who has completed more tickets finishes ahead. If still tied, the one amongst them who went later in the turn order finishes ahead.*

### CABOOSE

The player who came in last place takes the caboose card and stores it in their office.

### SOMEONE MISS A GAME?

At the end of the campaign, players who missed a game will get a score for each game they missed (this is revealed at the end of the campaign).

### 2. Retire an Event

The player who has the caboose card chooses one event in the event **discard pile** and publicly retires it. It will no longer appear in future games. In the rare case that the discard pile is empty, no events are retired.

### 3. Check the Pause Card

Check the story deck to see if any new materials or rules need to be added to the game.

> Rule Z

> Rule AA

> Rule BB

### 6. Vault Materials

Players put their bank slip in their vault.
