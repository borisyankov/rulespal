# The White Castle Rulebook

Japan, 1761: Harima province. Daimyo Sakai Tadazumi is one of the most significant advisors to the Edo Shogunate, and governs the region from Himeji Castle. Thus, it is in the best interest of the various local clans to curry favor with the Sakai clan. To achieve influence, they will have to insert members of their family into every level of life within the White Castle, from political roles to military positions, and even down to the lowliest landscape workers, who care for the smallest details of the palace’s gardens.

In *The White Castle*, players take on the role of leaders of minor clans, who vie for position and their clan’s future in the court of the White Heron. Cunning and timely management of resources and the placement of family members within Himeji Castle will be the key to victory!

## GAME SETUP

For your very first game, you should skip over Step 2 and use the cards shown in the picture. You can also skip Step 4 and make use of the tiles and the Well as shown in the picture. Be sure to place both a Mother-of-Pearl tile that has a coral die on the back and an Iron tile with a black die on the back in the Well.

### CASTLE SETUP:

1. Place the main board so that it can be reached by all players.
2. If there are **2 players**, leave the Steward and Diplomat cards that are marked with a TODO in the lower left corner back in the box. Then, shuffle the decks for the Steward level (ochre) and the Diplomat level (indigo) separately. Place 1 card face up in each space of the corresponding level. Put both of the remaining decks in the spaces for them on the main board.



### BRIDGES

7. Put the Bridges in their river spaces (or
you can play without the die-cut Bridges 
if you prefer). Take 3/4/5 dice of each 
color depending on whether there are 
2/3/4 players in the game. Put the extra 
dice back in the box. 
Roll the dice of each color and put them 
on their respective Bridges in ascending 
order from left to right, so that the 
lowest value is on the left of the Bridge 
near the lantern and the highest value 
is on the right. The others are placed in 
order across the center of the Bridge. 


## PLAYING THE GAME

> The white of the plaster on the walls and the white of the feathers on the herons that live in the area are in perfect harmony at Himeji Castle.

A game of *The White Castle* is divided into 3 rounds of play, during which each player takes 3 turns.

The player who is at the top of the Turn Order track is the first to take their turn. Once that player has concluded their turn, it is the next player shown on the track. Once all the players have played **3 turns** (that is, once they have played 3 dice each and there are a total of 3 dice left on the Bridges), then that round comes to a close (see End of the Round, page 13) and the next round begins. At the end of the third round, it passes on to the End of the Game (see page 14).
