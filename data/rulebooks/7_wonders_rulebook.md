## ELEMENTS OF THE GAME

### AGE CARDS

Age cards represent Buildings you can construct during the game. The back of each card indicates to which Age the card belongs (Age I, Age II, and Age III).

There are seven different types of cards:

* Brown cards (Basic Materials) provide **common resources**: Clay, Stone, Ore, and Wood.
* Grey cards (Manufactured Products) provide **rare resources**: Glass, Cloth, and Papyrus.
* Blue cards (Civil Buildings) provide **victory points**.
* Yellow cards (Commercial Buildings) provide **commercial advantages**.
* Red cards (Military Buildings) increase your **military strength**.
* Green cards (Science Buildings) provide **scientific advancements**
in three domains.
* Purple cards (Guilds) provide **victory points** according to certain conditions.

On the front of each Age card is a cost zone, an effect, a name, a colorblind friendly symbol, possibly one or two chain symbols, and a minimum number of players required. On the back is the number of the Age and the direction for passing.

### WONDER BOARD

Each board represents a Wonder you can construct during the game. Wonders have a Day side and a Night side showing two, three, or four different construction stages.
Each construction stage has a cost and an effect.
Your Wonder board will also provide you with a starting resource.

### MILITARY CONFLICT TOKENS

Military Conflict tokens represent your Military Victories and Defeats. There are four types of Military Conflict tokens:

* Military Defeat -1 tokens
* Military Victory +1 tokens
* Military Victory +3 tokens
* Military Victory +5 tokens

### COINS

Coins represent your **Treasure**. They are worth 1 or 3.

*Note: In these rules, when you see “x Coins,” the “x” corresponds to the total value of your Coins. In other words, “Take x Coins” means you take Coins worth a total of x.*

### DESCRIPTION OF EFFECTS SHEETS

These sheets provide a complete explanation of all the symbols in the game.

### SCORE PAD

This score pad is used at the end of the game to count your victory points and determine a winner.

### LIST OF CARDS AND CHAINS SHEET

This sheet is for your information.

## SETUP

1. Prepare the **Age cards**:
   * Separate the Age cards into three decks: Age I, Age II, and Age III.
   * For each Age, sort the cards by the minimum number of players required and keep only the cards with a number **less than or equal** to the number of players. Put the other cards back in the box, they will not be used during the game.
   *Example: In a 5-player game, keep all cards with 3+, 4+, and 5+ in each deck of Age cards.*
   * In the Age III deck, take all the Purple cards. Randomly draw as many cards from these as the **number of players +2** and keep them face down. Add these cards to the other Age III cards. Put the other Purple cards back in the box, they will not be used during the game.
   *Example: In a 5-player game, you will randomly draw 7 Purple cards (5 players + 2).*
   * Shuffle each deck of Age cards and put them face down in the middle of the table.
2. Each player randomly takes **a Wonder Board** and places it in front of themself, picking their preferred side (Day or Night).
*Note: For your first few games, we recommend using the Day side of the Wonder boards. For any following games, feel free to mix Day and Night sides. If you like, you can also choose Wonder boards instead of distributing them randomly.*
3. Take **3 Coins** (worth 1) and place them on your Wonder board. These Coins make up your starting Treasure. Place the leftover Coins in the middle of the table to make the **Coin reserve**.
4. Place all of the Military Conflict tokens in the middle of the table to make the Military Conflict token reserve.
5. All other game contents are put back in the box and will not be used during this game.

## GAMEPLAY

A game plays over **three successive rounds**: Age I, Age II, then Age III. Each round plays in a similar fashion. Victory points are scored at the end of Age III.

### Definitions:

**Neighbors**: The term “neighbors” refers to the player directly on your left **and** the player directly on your right.

**City**: The term “City” refers to your developments, which includes your Wonder and constructed cards.

### OVERVIEW OF AN AGE

At the start of each Age, take the corresponding deck of cards (I, II, or III) and randomly deal 7 cards to each player face down.
These cards will make up your starting hand.
Each Age has 6 turns during which you all play simultaneously. A turn is comprised of three stages, which happen in this order:

1. Choose a card
2. Play this card
3. Pass your hand

### 1. CHOOSE A CARD

Take stock of the cards in your hand without showing them to the other players.
From these cards, choose 1 and place it face down in front of you.
Set the remaining cards aside face down. They will be used later.

### 2. PLAY THIS CARD

When **everyone** has chosen a card, play them **simultaneously**.
You can use this card to complete **one single action** from the ones listed below:
A. Construct the Building on your card
B. Construct a stage of your Wonder
C. Sell the card

*Note: At the start of your first game, we recommend paying attention to everyone’s actions, playing one after another, to familiarize yourself with the game.*

#### A. Construct the Building on your card

To construct the Building on your card, pay any listed costs and place it face up above your Wonder board (see Constructing in 7 Wonders pages 6-7). Once built, the Building will remain in your City until the end of the game.

*Important: You can never construct two identical Buildings, meaning no two cards in your City can have the same name.*

CARD PLACEMENT IN YOUR CITY

Stack cards of the same color making sure to keep their effects visible and stack resources above your starting resource. (See example on page 8).

#### B. Construct a stage of your Wonder

To construct a stage of your Wonder, pay **only** the cost shown on your **Wonder board** for this stage (see Construct in 7 Wonders pages 6-7). Put your card face down under your board so that half is covered by the stage of the Wonder you are constructing. The effect of this stage is now available to you for the rest of the game.

*Note: You can use any card to construct a Wonder stage and this card has no other use besides activating the effect of this stage.*

**Wonder stages** can be constructed at **any moment** during the game. In other words, you can construct the first stage of your Wonder in Age I, II, or III. However, you are **required to construct the stages of your Wonder from left to right** (stage 1 before stage 2, then stage 2 before stage 3).

*Note: Constructing stages of your Wonder is **optional**.*

#### C. Sell the card

To gain Coins, you can sell your card. To do so, discard your card face down in the middle of the table (onto a pile that makes up the **discard**) and take **3 Coins** from the reserve that you add to your Treasure.

## 3. PASS YOUR HAND

When all players have completed their action, take the cards you did not choose and give them to the neighbor on your left (during Ages I and III) or to the neighbor on your right (during Age II). The **direction for passing** is shown on the back of the Age cards.

**You will therefore receive a hand of cards from your neighbor.** These cards will make up your new hand of cards for the next turn. You will have one fewer cards each turn, and will ultimately have only two on the last turn.

### SIXTH AND LAST TURN

At the start of the sixth and last turn of each Age, you will receive a hand of 2 cards from your neighbor. Choose 1 of these cards and discard the other face down to the discard pile. The discarded card does not give you any Coins. Play your sixth and last card as normal.

**Continue to the Resolution of Military Conflicts.**

### RESOLUTION OF MILITARY CONFLICTS

**Each Age ends with the Resolution of Military Conflicts.**

Count all military symbols on cards you have constructed and those on your Wonder board, if any, to determine your **military strength**. Then compare your total military strength with that of each of your neighbors.

For **each** neighbor:

* If your military strengths are equal, neither one of you takes a token.
* If your military strength is lower, take a Military Defeat token.
* If your military strength is higher, take the Military Victory token that corresponds to the current Age.

After the Resolution of Conflicts, the current Age ends and you continue to the next Age. After the Resolution of Conflicts in Age III, continue to the End of the game (page 8).

***Example**: At the end of Age II, your military strength is 4. The strength of the neighbor on your left is 5 and the strength of the one to your right is 2. You suffer a Defeat against the neighbor on your left and therefore take a Military Defeat token. You emerge as the victor of the Conflict against the neighbor on your right and take a Victory token for Age II.*

## CONSTRUCTING IN 7 WONDERS

During the entire game, you will have the option of constructing **Buildings** or **Wonder stages**. To do this, you must pay the corresponding construction cost, shown on the cost zone of cards or each of the Wonder stages.

***Reminder**: You can never construct two identical Buildings, meaning you cannot have two cards with the same name in your City.*

There are different types of costs:
A. No cost
B. Coin cost
C. Resource cost
D. Free cost through chains

### A. NO COST

**If the cost zone is empty, the card is free** and requires no resources or Coins to be constructed.

### B. COIN COST

Certain cards cost 1 Coin. Take 1 Coin from your Treasure and place it in the reserve when constructing the Building on the card.

C. RESOURCE COST
Certain cards and Wonder stages require one or more resources to be constructed. You can use resources produced by your City **and/or** buy resources from your neighbors.

***Important**: Resources used for constructing are never lost and can be used on every turn of the entire game.*

#### Using resources produced by your City

You produce **one resource per resource symbol shown in your City**: starting resource on your Wonder board, Grey, Brown, and Yellow cards, and certain Wonder stages. **Each resource symbol can only be used once per turn.**

***Example**: You produce 2 Stones, 1 Ore, and 1 Papyrus. You can therefore construct the Barracks since your City produces 1 Ore, or the Scriptorium since your City also produces 1 Papyrus. However, you cannot construct the Guard Tower since you do not produce Clay.*

#### Buying resources from a neighboring City

If your City does not produce the resources needed to construct a card or Wonder stage, check your neighbors’ Cities. If they produce the resources you need, you can buy these resources from them.

For each resource bought, give **2 Coins** to the owner of the resource. **This player keeps their card and can still use the resource you just bought.**

Each resource symbol can only be bought **once per turn by the same player**. Resources must be used on the same turn as they were bought.

Resources you can buy from your neighbors include:

* The starting resource on their Wonder board;
* Resources on their Brown cards;
* Resources on their Grey cards.

It is **impossible** to buy resources produced by their Yellow cards or the stages of their Wonder.

If your neighbor has a card that produces **a choice of 1 resource** from two resources
shown, you can choose which one to buy, **regardless of what your neighbor has chosen.**

**Notes:**

* To buy resources, you must spend the required Coins at the beginning of your turn. You cannot use Coins you receive from other players during the same turn.
* You cannot buy resources from a Building your neighbor constructed that same turn.
* You can never prevent a player from buying your resources.
* Both of your neighbors can buy the same resource from your City.

### D. FREE COST THROUGH CHAINS

Starting in Age II, certain cards have a **free construction condition** shown as a **chain symbol**. If you have previously constructed a card with the same symbol in the upper right corner, you can construct this card **for free**.

***Example**: In Age I, if you constructed the Theater in your City, you can construct the Gardens in Age II for free, since you have the corresponding chain symbol.*

**Notes:**

* If you do not have the symbol that corresponds to a card’s chain, you can still construct
this card by paying its resource cost.
* Certain cards grant access to two chains; in this case, you will see two symbols in the upper
right corner of the card.

## END OF THE GAME

The game ends at the close of Age III, after the Resolution of Military Conflicts. Proceed with counting victory points by using the score pad. The player with the highest score wins the game.
