## INTRODUCTION AND AIM OF THE GAME

Jaipur... You are hoping to become the Maharaja’s personal trader by being richer than your opponent at the end of each week *(round)*.

To do so, collect and exchange goods *(cards)* at the market, then sell them for rupees *(on the back of the tokens)*. If you manage to put together a really good deal *(three cards or more)*, then you’ll receive a reward *(bonus token)*.

As for the camels, they are mainly used for exchanges when you want to take multiple goods at the market.

**At the end of each round, the richer trader receives a Seal of Excellence. The first player to collect 2 of these wins the game.**

## MATERIAL

* 55 goods cards
  * 6 x diamonds
  * 6 x gold
  * 6 x silver
  * 8 x cloth
  * 8 x spice
  * 10 x leather
  * 11 x camels back
* 38 goods tokens
* 3 Seals of Excellence
* 1 camel token
* 18 bonus tokens

Note: the value of the goods tokens is shown in small type on the front and large on the back. The value of the bonus tokens is only shown on the back.

## SET-UP

* Place 3 camel cards face up between the players.
* Shuffle the remaining cards well.
* Deal 5 cards to each player.
* The remaining cards are left face down as a draw pile (deck).
* Take the first two cards from the deck and place them face up next to the camels. *(There may well be 1 or 2 camels drawn.)* The **market** is now ready.
* The players then remove any camels from their hands and put them face up in a in a stack in front of them. This forms each player’s **herd.**
* Sort the tokens by goods type.
* Make a pile for each goods type in descending order of value.
* Spread out each pile so that both players can see all the tokens’ values.
* Sort the bonus tokens by type. Shuffle each type separately, then form 3 piles, which are not spread out.
* Put the camel token next to the bonus tokens.
* Set up the tokens as shown in the above illustration.
* Put the 3 Seals of Excellence where the players can get at them.

Pick a starting player.

You are now ready to start playing.

## GAME TURN

On your turn, you can either:

**TAKE CARDS OR SELL CARDS**

But never both!

Your turn is now over and your opponent chooses one of these actions.

## TAKE CARDS

If you take cards, you must choose one of the following options:

* A. take **several** goods (=EXCHANGE !),
* B. take **1 single** good,
* C. take **all** the camels.

These 3 options are shown in detail below.

### A. Take several goods

Take **all** the goods cards that you want into your hand *(they can be of different types),* then exchange **the same number** of cards. The returned cards can **be camels, goods, or a combination of the two.**

### B. Take 1 single good

Take **a single** goods card from the market into your hand, then replace it with the top card from the deck.

### C. Take the camels

Take **ALL** the camels from the market and add them to your herd, then replace the cards taken by drawing from the deck.

**ATTENTION: Players may never have more than 7 cards in their hand at the end of their turn.**

## SELL CARDS

To sell cards, choose one type of good and discard as many cards of that type as you like onto the discard pile. Each sale earns goods tokens and, if the sale is big enough, a bonus.

A sale is carried out in 3 steps.

### Step 1

Sell as many cards as you want, placing them face up on the discard pile.

### Step 2

Take as many tokens as cards discarded (starting with the “top” of the corresponding row, that is, starting with the highest values.)

Stack the tokens in front of you.

### Step 3

If you sell 3 or more cards, take the corresponding bonus token.

*Note: the value of a bonus is not known until it is drawn. For **3 cards sold**, it will be 1, 2 or 3 rupees. For **4 cards sold**, it will be 4, 5 or 6 rupees and for **5 cards sold**, it will be 8, 9 or 10 rupees. Unlike the goods tokens, the rupee value of the bonus token is only printed on the back (hence the question marks on the front).*

### Restrictions during a sale

When selling the 3 most expensive goods (diamonds, gold and silver), the sale must include **a minimum** of 2 cards. *(This rule applies even if there is only one goods token of a given type left.)*

*REMINDER: You can only sell **one goods type** each round, never more.*

## END OF A ROUND

A round ends **immediately** if:

3 types of goods token are depleted.

or

There are no cards left in the draw pile when trying to fill the market.

## SCORING

* The player with the most camels in his herd receives the camel token, worth 5 rupees.
* The players turn over their tokens and add them up to determine who is the richer.
* The richer trader takes a Seal of Excellence.
* In the case of a tie, the player with the most **bonus tokens** takes
the seal. If the players are still tied, the one with the most goods
tokens takes the seal.

## NEW ROUND

If neither player has 2 Seals of Excellence yet, set up the game again from the beginning and play a new round. The player who lost the previous round starts.

## END OF THE GAME

The game ends immediately as soon as one of the players has 2 Seals of Excellence. That player wins the game and is appointed as the Maharaja’s personal trader.

## REMINDERS AND NOTES

* When you take cards from the market, you either take goods or camels, but **never** both.
* If you decide to take the camels, you must always take **all** the camels at the market.
* When making an exchange:
  * the surrendered cards can be camels, goods or a mixture of the two;
  * the same goods type cannot be both surrendered and taken at the market;
  * you can **never** exchange just 1 card from your hand against 1 from the market. An exchange always involves **at least** 2 cards for 2 cards.
* If both players have the same number of camels at the end of a round, neither takes the camel token (5 rupees).
* Sometimes there are fewer tokens available than cards during a sale. In that case, you still receive the bonus token for the number of cards sold.
* Players are not required to let their opponent know how many camels they possess.
* Camels do not count towards the 7 card hand limit.

## ADVICE

* The use of the camels is a balancing act: if you don’t have any then you have a problem if you want to take a lot of cards and your hand is empty. However, if you take a lot of camels then you risk leaving a very profitable market for your opponent.
* If you do decide to take a large group of camels, it can be worthwhile doing this when your opponent already has 7 cards in hand. Then, if the new market is interesting, he’ll have to exchange cards and probably won’t be able to take all the cards wanted.
* If you think that some valuable cards are due to turn up, it can be advantageous to make an exchange that fills the market with camels, forcing your opponent to open up the game for you.
* There are three main sources of income: the 3 expensive goods, the first tokens in each set, and the big sales bonuses. All three are important: don’t let your opponent grab the lion’s share of the diamonds, gold and silver, sell before him if you can, and try to make one or two really big sales!
