# Arkham Horror The Card Game Rules Reference

## The Thing That Should Not Be…

> The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.
—H. P. Lovecraft, “The Call of Cthulhu”

This document is intended as the definitive source for rules information, but does not teach players how to play the game. Players should first read the Learn to Play book in its entirety and use this Rules Reference as needed while playing the game.

The majority of this guide consists of a glossary, which provides an alphabetical listing of terms and situations a player might encounter during a game. This section should be the first destination for players who have a rules question.

The latter part of this guide contains four appendices. The first appendix describes the process of playing cards or initiating triggered abilities. The second appendix provides timing diagrams that illustrate the structure of a game round, as well as a detailed explanation of how to handle each game step presented in those diagrams. The third appendix lists the complete rules for setting up a game of *Arkham Horror: The Card Game.* The fourth appendix provides a detailed anatomy of each cardtype.

## The Golden Rules

If the text of this Rules Reference directly contradicts the text of the Learn to Play book, the text of the Rules Reference takes precedence.

If the text of a card directly contradicts the text of either the Rules Reference or the Learn to Play book, the text of the card takes precedence.

## The Grim Rule

If players are unable to find the answer to a rules or timing conflict in this Rules Reference, resolve the conflict in the manner that the players perceive as the worst possible at that moment with regards to winning the scenario, and continue with the game.

## Glossary

The following is an alphabetical list of entries for game rules, terms, and situations that may occur during play.

### A, An

When used to describe a condition, the words “a” or “an” are satisfied if one or more of the conditional elements are present. *For example, an investigator with 3 resources will satisfy the condition of “Each investigator with a resource.”*

### Ability

An ability is the specialized game text that indicates how a card affects the game.

* Card abilities only interact with the game if the card bearing the ability is in play, unless the ability (or rules for the cardtype) specifically references its use from an out-of-play area.
* Card abilities only interact with other cards that are in play, unless the ability specifically references an interaction with cards in an out-of-play area.
* If multiple instances of the same ability are in play, each instance interacts with (or may interact with) the game state individually.

The various types of card abilities are: constant abilities, forced abilities, revelation abilities, triggered abilities, keywords, and enemy instructions (spawn and prey). Each type is described in detail below.

See also: “Costs” on page 7, “Effects” on page 9, “Qualifiers” on page 17, “Self-Referential Text” on page 18.

### Constant Abilities

Constant abilities are simply stated on a card with no special formatting. Constant abilities are always interacting with the game state as long as the card is in play. (Some constant abilities continuously seek a specific condition, denoted by words such as “during” or “while.” The effects of such abilities are active any time the specified condition is met.) Constant abilities have no point of initiation.

### Forced Abilities

A forced ability is identified by a bold **“Forced** –” command. Forced abilities initiate and interact with the game state automatically at a specified timing point. Such a timing point is usually indicated by words such as: “when,” “after,” “if,” or “at.”

* If a forced ability does not have the potential to change the game state, the ability does not initiate.
* The initiation of a forced ability that has the potential to change the game state is mandatory each time its specified timing point is met.
* A forced ability with a timing point beginning with the word “when...” automatically initiates as soon as the specified timing point is reached, but before its impact upon the game state resolves.
* A forced ability with a timing point beginning with the word “after...” automatically initiates immediately after that timing point’s impact upon the game state has resolved.
* For any given timing point, all forced abilities initiated in reference to that timing point must resolve before any abilities (see below) referencing the same timing point in the same manner may be initiated.

See “Priority of Simultaneous Resolution” on page 17.

### Revelation Abilities

A revelation ability, indicated by a bold **“Revelation** –” command on an encounter card or weakness, initiates as that card is drawn by an investigator (see “Revelation” on page 18).

### Triggered Abilities

A triggered ability is any ability prefaced by either a  icon, a  icon, or an  icon. If the ability has one or more prerequisites (costs and/or conditions), these are listed in text immediately following the icon. A player must always meet the prerequisites of a triggered ability in order to trigger that ability. There are three types of triggered abilities:

Free triggered abilities ()—A  triggered ability may be triggered as a player ability during any player window. (See “Appendix II: Timing and Gameplay” on page 22 for a complete list of player windows.)

Reaction triggered abilities ()—A  triggered ability with a specified triggering condition may be triggered any time that triggering condition is met.
*For example: “ After you defeat an enemy:”*

* A  ability with a triggering condition beginning with the word “when...” may be used after the specified triggering condition initiates, but before its impact upon the game state resolves.
* A  ability with a triggering condition beginning with the word “after...” may be used immediately after that triggering condition’s impact upon the game state has resolved.
* Each  ability may be triggered only once each time the specified condition on the ability is met. *For example, an ability that is triggered “After X occurs,” may be used once each time “X” occurs.*

Action triggered abilities ()—An  triggered ability may be triggered during a player’s turn in the investigation phase through the use of the activate action, and only if the player uses one action for each  specified in the ability’s cost.

All triggered abilities are governed by the following rules:

* Triggered abilities on a card a player controls are optionally triggered (or not) by that player at the appropriate timing moment, as indicated by the ability.
* A triggered ability can only be initiated if its effect has the potential to change the game state, and its cost (if any) has the potential to be paid in full, taking active cost modifiers into account. This potential is assessed without taking into account the consequences of the cost payment or any other ability interactions.
* Once an ability is initiated, players must resolve as much of the effect as possible, unless the effect uses the word “may” (see “May” on page 15).

### Keywords

A keyword is a card ability which conveys specific rules to its card (see “Keywords” on page 13).

### Spawn Instructions and Prey Instructions

Spawn instructions inform where an enemy spawns as it enters play (see “Spawn” on page 19).

Prey instructions inform which investigator an enemy pursues and/or engages if it has a choice (see “Prey” on page 17).

### Action Designators

Some abilities have bold action designators (such as Fight, Evade, Investigate, or Move). Activating such an ability performs the designated action as described in the rules, but modified in the manner described by the ability.

## Act Deck and Agenda Deck

The act deck represents the progress the investigators can make in a scenario. The agenda deck represents the progress and objectives of the dark forces arrayed against the investigators in a scenario. Generally, advancing the act deck is good for the investigators, and advancing the agenda deck is bad for the investigators.

* The act deck advances if the investigators, as a group, spend the requisite number of clues (as indicated by the act card). An act card may indicate a flat value (such as “4”) or a per investigator value (as indicated by the  icon). This is normally done as a  player ability. Any or all investigators may contribute any number of clues towards the total number of clues required to advance the act. If the act has an **“Objective** –” instruction, that instruction overrides or adds additional requirements to the spending of those clues.
* The agenda deck advances if the requisite number of doom is in play (doom on the agenda card as well as doom on any other cards in play), as indicated by the agenda card. An agenda card may indicate a flat value or a per investigator value. If the agenda has an **“Objective** –” instruction, that instruction overrides or adds additional requirements to meeting this doom requirement.
* The act/agenda on top of the act/agenda deck is referred to as the “current” act/agenda.

To advance the act deck or the agenda deck, follow these steps, in order:

1. Remove all tokens from the card to be advanced. If the agenda deck is advancing, remove all doom from each card in play.
2. Flip the advancing card over and follow the instructions on the reverse (“b”) side.
   * If the reverse side of the act or agenda is an encounter card, follow the rules for drawing that encounter cardtype. Otherwise, simply follow the instructions on the card.
3. Sometimes, the advancing act/agenda specifies which card becomes the next act/agenda. If it does not, the next card in the deck becomes the current act/agenda. As a new card becomes the current act/agenda, the advancing card is simultaneously removed from the game.
   * Some instructions in the act and agenda decks (as well as on other encounter cardtypes) contain resolution points, in the format of: “(→R#).” If a resolution point is reached, the scenario ends. Read the designated resolution in the campaign guide.

See also: “Clues” on page 6, “Doom” on page 9.

### Action

During his or her turn, an investigator is permitted to take up to **three** actions. When performing an action, all costs of the action are first paid. Then, the consequences of the action resolve.

* If an investigator is instructed to lose 1 or more actions, he or she has that many fewer actions to take during that round.

For a complete list of the available actions, see section “2.2.1
Investigator takes an action, if able.” on page 24.

### Activate Action

“Activate” is an action an investigator may take during his or her turn in the investigation phase.

When this action is taken, the investigator initiates an ability that specifies one or more  icons as part of its ability cost. The number of  icons in the ability’s cost determines how many actions the investigator is required to use for this activate action. When performing an activate action, all of that action’s costs are simultaneously paid. Then, the consequences of that action resolve.

An investigator is permitted to activate abilities from the following sources:

* A card in play and under his or her control. This includes his or her investigator card.
* A scenario card that is in play and at the same location as the investigator. This includes the location itself, encounter cards placed at that location, and all encounter cards in the threat area of any investigator at that location.
* The current act or current agenda card.
  
### Active Player

The active player is the player taking his or her turn during the investigation phase.

### After

The word “after” refers to the moment immediately after the specified timing point or triggering condition has fully resolved.

*(For example, an ability that reads “After you draw an enemy card” initiates immediately after resolving all of the steps for drawing an enemy—resolving its revelation ability, spawning it, etc.)*

See also: “Ability” on page 2, “Priority of
Simultaneous Resolution” on page 17.

### Agenda Deck

See “Act Deck and Agenda Deck” on page 3.

### Aloof

Aloof is a keyword ability. An enemy with the aloof keyword does not automatically engage investigators at its location.

* When an aloof enemy spawns, it spawns unengaged.
* An investigator may use the engage action or a card ability to engage an aloof enemy.
* An investigator cannot attack an aloof enemy while that enemy is not engaged with an investigator.
  
### Asset Cards

Asset cards represent items, allies, talents, spells, and other reserves that may assist or be used by an investigator during a scenario.

* When you play an asset, it is placed in your play area. Generally, assets remain in play unless discarded by a card ability or game step.
* Some assets have health and/or sanity. When an investigator is dealt damage or horror, that investigator may assign some or all of that damage or horror to eligible asset cards he or she controls (see “Dealing Damage/Horror” on page 7).
* Most assets take up one or more slots while in play (see “Slots” on page 19).
* Some assets have an encounter set icon and no level indicator. Such assets are known as Story Assets. Story Assets are part of an encounter set and may not be included in a player’s deck unless the resolution or setup of a scenario grants that player permission to do so.

### Attach To

If a card uses the phrase “attach to” it must be attached to (placed beneath and slightly overlapped by) the specified game element as it enters play. Once attached, such a card is referred to as an attachment.

* The “attach to” phrase is checked for legality each time a card would be attached to a game element, but is not checked again after that attachment occurs. If the initial “attach to” check does not pass, the card is not able to be attached, and remains in its prior state or game area. If such a card cannot remain in its prior state or game area, discard it.
* Once in play, an attachment remains attached until either the attachment or the game element to which it is attached leaves play (in which case the attachment is discarded), or unless a card ability explicitly detaches the card.
* An attachment exhausts and readies independently of the game element it’s attached to.

### Attacker, Attacked

An “attacker” is an entity (usually an enemy or investigator) that is resolving its attack against another entity. The entity being attacked is referred to as the “attacked enemy” or the “attacked investigator.”

### Attack of Opportunity

Each time an investigator is engaged with one or more ready enemies and takes an action other than to fight, to evade, or to activate a parley or resign ability, each of those enemies makes an attack of opportunity against the investigator, in the order of the investigator’s choosing. Each attack deals that enemy’s damage and horror to the investigator.

* An attack of opportunity is made immediately after all costs of initiating the action that provoked the attack have been paid, but before the application of that action’s effect upon the game state.
* An ability that costs more than one action only provokes one attack of opportunity from each engaged enemy.
* An enemy does not exhaust while making an attack of opportunity.
* After all attacks of opportunity are made, continue with the resolution of the action which instigated the attack.
* Attacks of opportunity count as enemy attacks for the purposes of card abilities.
  
### Automatic Failure/Success

Some card or token abilities may cause a skill test to automatically fail or to automatically succeed. If a skill test automatically fails or automatically succeeds, it does so during step “ST.6” of the “Skill Test Timing” process outlined on page 26.

* If a skill test automatically fails, the investigator’s total skill value for that test is considered 0.
* If a skill test automatically succeeds, the total difficulty of that test is considered 0.

### Base Value

Base value is the value of an element before any modifiers are applied. Unless otherwise specified, the base value of an element derived from a card is the value printed on that card.

### Bearer

The bearer of a weakness is the investigator who started the game with the weakness in his or her deck or play area.
See “Weakness” on page 21.

### Blank

If a card’s printed text box is considered “blank” by an ability, that text box is treated as if it did not have any of its printed content. Text and/or icons gained from another source are not blanked.

* A card’s text box includes: traits, keywords, card text and abilities.

### Campaign Play

A campaign is a series of interrelated scenarios in which each player plays the same investigator from one scenario to the next. As a campaign progresses, the investigator gains experience and trauma, and this is reflected by changes in his or her deck. Each decision made in a campaign may have repercussions in a later scenario.

When starting a campaign, follow the instructions for that campaign’s setup in the campaign guide. After playing through a scenario during a campaign, record the specified results of that scenario in the campaign log.

#### Experience

After recording the results of a scenario, the investigators are ready to reflect on their experiences and purchase new cards for their decks. To do this, follow these steps, in order:

1. Count experience. Each investigator earns experience equal to the total victory value of all cards in the victory display plus or minus any bonuses or penalties indicated by the campaign guide for that resolution. This total is added to any unspent experience an investigator has recorded from previous scenarios in this campaign.
2. Purchase new cards. New cards may be purchased and added to a player’s deck by spending experience equal to the card’s level (denoted by a number of pips in the upper left hand corner of the card). While purchasing new cards, observe the following rules:
   * An investigator’s deckbuilding guidelines (found on the back of the investigator card) must be observed while that investigator is purchasing new cards. Only cards the investigator has access to may be purchased. The deck-size requirement must also be maintained, so that for each (nonpermanent) card purchased and added to a deck, a different card is removed from the deck. Weakness cards and cards that must be included in an investigator’s deck may not be removed while that investigator is purchasing new cards.
   * Each card costs experience equal to the card’s level, to a minimum of 1 (purchasing a level zero card still costs 1 experience). The number of pips beneath a card’s cost indicates the card’s level.
   * When purchasing a higher level version of a card with the same title, the investigator may choose to “upgrade” that card by paying only the difference in experience (to a minimum of 1) between the two cards and removing the lower level version of the card from his or her deck.
   * New cards are purchased (or upgraded) individually. If an investigator wishes to purchase more than 1 copy of a new card, each copy must be paid for separately, and one card must be removed from that investigator's deck for each copy purchased.
   * The above processes, and any specific instructions provided by the campaign guide, are the only methods by which a player may modify his or her deck during a campaign.
3. Record unspent experience. Each investigator records any unspent experience on the campaign log. This experience may be spent at a later time during this campaign.

#### Trauma

Trauma reflects permanent damage that has been done to an investigator’s health and/or psyche.

If an investigator is defeated in a scenario that investigator is eliminated from the scenario but not necessarily from the campaign.

If an investigator is defeated by taking damage equal to his or her health, he or she suffers 1 physical trauma (recorded in the campaign log). For each physical trauma an investigator has, that investigator begins each subsequent scenario in the campaign with 1 damage. If an investigator has physical trauma equal to his or her printed health, the investigator is killed.

If an investigator is defeated by taking horror equal to his or her sanity, he or she suffers 1 mental trauma (recorded in the campaign log). For each mental trauma an investigator has, that investigator begins each subsequent scenario in the campaign with 1 horror. If an investigator has mental trauma equal to his or her printed sanity, the investigator is driven insane.

If an investigator is defeated by simultaneously taking damage equal to his or her health and horror equal to his or her sanity, he or she chooses which type of trauma to suffer.

If an investigator is killed or driven insane, that player must choose a new investigator to use in the next scenario, and creates a new deck for that investigator. Investigators that are killed or driven insane cannot be used for the remainder of the campaign (see “Killed/Insane Investigators” on page 13).

If a player attempts to choose a new investigator and there are no investigators remaining in the pool, the players have lost and the campaign ends.

#### Defeat by Card Ability

An investigator may be defeated by a card ability. A defeated investigator is eliminated from the game (see “Elimination” on page 10). Should this occur, follow the instructions of the card ability to determine if there are any long-term repercussions of the defeat.

#### Advancing to Next Scenario

After completing a scenario, resolving its resolution, updating the campaign log, and purchasing any new cards, advance to the next scenario (sequentially) in the campaign, unless the scenario resolution explicitly directs the investigators to a different scenario.

#### Joining or Leaving a Campaign

Once a campaign has begun, players can freely drop in and out of the campaign in between scenarios.

If a player leaves the campaign, do not delete that player’s information from the campaign log, as he or she may re-join at any time between scenarios.

If a new player joins the campaign, he or she must choose an investigator not previously used during this campaign. That player begins as if it were his or her first scenario in the campaign, with no experience and no trauma.

### Cancel

Some card abilities can “cancel” other card or game effects. Cancel abilities interrupt the initiation of an effect, and prevent the effect from initiating.

* Any time the effects of an ability are canceled, the ability (apart from its effects) is still regarded as initiated, and any costs have still been paid. The effects of the ability, however, are prevented from initiating and do not resolve.
* If the effects of an event card are canceled, the card is still regarded as played, and it is still placed in its owner’s discard pile.
* If the effects of a treachery card are canceled, the card is still regarded as having been drawn, and it is still placed in the encounter discard pile.

### Cannot

The word “cannot” is absolute, and cannot be countermanded by other abilities.

### Cardtypes

The game’s cardtypes are presented in Appendix IV, with detailed card anatomies (see “Appendix IV: Card Anatomy” on page 28).

* If an ability causes a card to change its cardtype, it loses all other cardtypes it might possess and functions as would any card of the new cardtype.

See also: “Asset Cards” on page 4, “Enemy Cards” on page 10, “Event Cards” on page 11, “Location Cards” on page 14, “Skill Cards” on page 18, “Treachery Cards” on page 20.

### Chaos Tokens

Chaos tokens are revealed from the chaos bag during skill tests, to modify or influence the results of the skill test.

   —If any of these tokens are revealed for a skill test, resolve the effect for that symbol as indicated on the scenario reference card for the current scenario.

—This is the auto-fail token. If this token is revealed for a skill test, it indicates the investigator automatically fails the test (see “Automatic Failure/Success” on page 5).

—This is the elder sign token. If this token is revealed
for a skill test, resolve the  effect on the investigator card
belonging to the player performing the skill test.

If a revealed chaos token (or the effect referenced by a chaos token) has a numerical modifier, that modifier is applied to the investigator’s skill value for this test.

See “ST.3 Reveal chaos token.” on page 26.

### Clues

Clues represent the progress the investigators can make towards solving a mystery, unraveling a conspiracy, and/or advancing in a scenario.

* The first time an investigator enters a location, that location is revealed (turned face-up) and a number of clues equal to that location’s clue value are placed on that location (from the token pool). Most clue values are conveyed as a “per investigator ()” value. This may occur during setup.
* A clue at a location can be discovered by successfully investigating the location (see “Investigate Action” on page 13), or by a card ability. If an investigator discovers a clue, he or she takes the clue from the location and places it on his or her investigator card, under his or her control.
* If there are no “Objective – ” requirements for advancing the current act, during any investigator’s turn the investigators may, as a group, spend the requisite number of clues (usually conveyed as a “per investigator” value) from their investigator cards to advance the act deck. This is normally done as a  player ability. Any or all investigators may contribute any number of clues towards the total number of clues required to advance the act.
* A card ability that refers to clues “at a location” is referring to the undiscovered clues that are currently on that location.

See also: “Act Deck and Agenda Deck” on page 3, “Tokens, Running out of ” on page 20.

### Collection

If an ability refers to a player’s collection *(for example, “search the collection”),* the collection of cards from which that player’s deck was assembled is used.

*Example: Sean and Etienne are each using a deck built from Sean’s collection. If Etienne is instructed to “search the collection,” he searches Sean’s collection.*

### Constant Abilities

See “Ability” on page 2.

### Control

See “Ownership and Control” on page 16.

### Copy

A copy of a card is defined by title. A second copy of a card is any other card that shares the same title, regardless of cardtype, text, artwork, or any other differing characteristics between the cards.

### Costs

There are two types of costs in the game: resource costs and ability costs.

A card’s resource cost is the numerical value that must be paid (in resources) to play the card from hand. To pay a resource cost, an investigator takes the specified number of resources from his or her resource pool and places them in the token pool.

Some triggered card abilities are presented in a “cost: effect” construct. In such a construct, the aspect preceding the colon indicates the ability costs that must be paid and any triggering conditions that must be met to trigger the ability. The aspect following the colon is the effect.

* If multiple costs for a single card or ability require payment, those costs must be paid simultaneously.
* Only the controller of a card or ability may pay its costs. Game elements another player controls may not be used to pay a cost
* When a player is exhausting, sacrificing, or otherwise using cards to pay costs, only cards that are in play and under that player’s control may be used, unless the cost specifies an out-of-play state.
* If a cost requires a game element that is not in play, the player paying the cost may only use game elements that are in his or her game areas (such as his or her hand or deck) to pay the cost.
* If the investigators are instructed to pay a cost as a group, each investigator (or each investigator in the group defined by the ability) may contribute to paying the cost.
* An ability cannot initiate—and therefore its costs cannot be paid—if the resolution of its effect will not change the game state.
* If an investigator takes damage or horror as a cost and reassigns any of it to an asset, the cost is still considered paid.

### Dealing Damage/Horror

There are two types of afflictions that may beset an investigator in the game: damage and horror. Damage afflicts an investigator’s health, and horror afflicts an investigator’s sanity.

When an investigator or enemy is dealt damage and/or horror, follow these steps, in order:

1. **Assign Damage/Horror:** Determine the amount of damage and/or horror being dealt. Place damage and/or horror tokens equal to the amount of damage and horror being dealt next to the cards that will be taking the damage/horror.
   * When an investigator is dealt damage or horror, that investigator may assign it to eligible asset cards he or she controls. To be eligible, an asset card must have health in order to be assigned damage, and it must have sanity in order to be assigned horror.
   * An asset cannot be assigned damage beyond the amount of damage it would take to defeat the card, and cannot be assigned horror beyond the amount of horror it would take to defeat the card.
   * All damage/horror that cannot be assigned to an asset must be assigned to the investigator.
2. **Apply Damage/Horror:** Any assigned damage/horror that has not been prevented is now placed on each card to which it has been assigned, simultaneously. If no damage/horror is applied in this step, no damage/horror has been successfully dealt.
   * Abilities that prevent, reduce, or reassign damage and/or horror that is being dealt are resolved between steps 1 and 2.
   * After applying damage/horror, if an investigator has damage equal to or higher than his or her health or horror equal to or higher than his or her sanity, he or she is defeated. When an investigator is defeated, he or she is eliminated from the scenario (see “Elimination” on page 10).
   * After applying damage/horror, if an enemy has damage equal to or higher than its health, it is defeated and placed in the encounter discard pile (or in its owner’s discard pile if it is a weakness).
   * After applying damage/horror, if an asset has damage equal to or higher than its health or horror equal to or higher than its sanity, it is defeated and placed in its owner’s discard pile.
