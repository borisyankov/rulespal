# Arkham Horror The Card Game Rules Reference

## The Thing That Should Not Be…

> The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.
—H. P. Lovecraft, “The Call of Cthulhu”

This document is intended as the definitive source for rules information, but does not teach players how to play the game. Players should first read the Learn to Play book in its entirety and use this Rules Reference as needed while playing the game.

The majority of this guide consists of a glossary, which provides an alphabetical listing of terms and situations a player might encounter during a game. This section should be the first destination for players who have a rules question.

The latter part of this guide contains four appendices. The first appendix describes the process of playing cards or initiating triggered abilities. The second appendix provides timing diagrams that illustrate the structure of a game round, as well as a detailed explanation of how to handle each game step presented in those diagrams. The third appendix lists the complete rules for setting up a game of *Arkham Horror: The Card Game.* The fourth appendix provides a detailed anatomy of each cardtype.

## The Golden Rules

If the text of this Rules Reference directly contradicts the text of the Learn to Play book, the text of the Rules Reference takes precedence.

If the text of a card directly contradicts the text of either the Rules Reference or the Learn to Play book, the text of the card takes precedence.

## The Grim Rule

If players are unable to find the answer to a rules or timing conflict in this Rules Reference, resolve the conflict in the manner that the players perceive as the worst possible at that moment with regards to winning the scenario, and continue with the game.

## Glossary

The following is an alphabetical list of entries for game rules, terms, and situations that may occur during play.

### A, An

When used to describe a condition, the words “a” or “an” are satisfied if one or more of the conditional elements are present. *For example, an investigator with 3 resources will satisfy the condition of “Each investigator with a resource.”*

### Ability

An ability is the specialized game text that indicates how a card affects the game.

* Card abilities only interact with the game if the card bearing the ability is in play, unless the ability (or rules for the cardtype) specifically references its use from an out-of-play area.
* Card abilities only interact with other cards that are in play, unless the ability specifically references an interaction with cards in an out-of-play area.
* If multiple instances of the same ability are in play, each instance interacts with (or may interact with) the game state individually.

The various types of card abilities are: constant abilities, forced abilities, revelation abilities, triggered abilities, keywords, and enemy instructions (spawn and prey). Each type is described in detail below.

See also: “Costs” on page 7, “Effects” on page 9, “Qualifiers” on page 17, “Self-Referential Text” on page 18.

### Constant Abilities

Constant abilities are simply stated on a card with no special formatting. Constant abilities are always interacting with the game state as long as the card is in play. (Some constant abilities continuously seek a specific condition, denoted by words such as “during” or “while.” The effects of such abilities are active any time the specified condition is met.) Constant abilities have no point of initiation.

### Forced Abilities

A forced ability is identified by a bold **“Forced** –” command. Forced abilities initiate and interact with the game state automatically at a specified timing point. Such a timing point is usually indicated by words such as: “when,” “after,” “if,” or “at.”

* If a forced ability does not have the potential to change the game state, the ability does not initiate.
* The initiation of a forced ability that has the potential to change the game state is mandatory each time its specified timing point is met.
* A forced ability with a timing point beginning with the word “when...” automatically initiates as soon as the specified timing point is reached, but before its impact upon the game state resolves.
* A forced ability with a timing point beginning with the word “after...” automatically initiates immediately after that timing point’s impact upon the game state has resolved.
* For any given timing point, all forced abilities initiated in reference to that timing point must resolve before any abilities (see below) referencing the same timing point in the same manner may be initiated.

See “Priority of Simultaneous Resolution” on page 17.

### Revelation Abilities

A revelation ability, indicated by a bold **“Revelation** –” command on an encounter card or weakness, initiates as that card is drawn by an investigator (see “Revelation” on page 18).

### Triggered Abilities

A triggered ability is any ability prefaced by either a  icon, a  icon, or an  icon. If the ability has one or more prerequisites (costs and/or conditions), these are listed in text immediately following the icon. A player must always meet the prerequisites of a triggered ability in order to trigger that ability. There are three types of triggered abilities:

Free triggered abilities ()—A  triggered ability may be triggered as a player ability during any player window. (See “Appendix II: Timing and Gameplay” on page 22 for a complete list of player windows.)

Reaction triggered abilities ()—A  triggered ability with a specified triggering condition may be triggered any time that triggering condition is met.
*For example: “ After you defeat an enemy:”*

* A  ability with a triggering condition beginning with the word “when...” may be used after the specified triggering condition initiates, but before its impact upon the game state resolves.
* A  ability with a triggering condition beginning with the word “after...” may be used immediately after that triggering condition’s impact upon the game state has resolved.
* Each  ability may be triggered only once each time the specified condition on the ability is met. *For example, an ability that is triggered “After X occurs,” may be used once each time “X” occurs.*

Action triggered abilities ()—An  triggered ability may be triggered during a player’s turn in the investigation phase through the use of the activate action, and only if the player uses one action for each  specified in the ability’s cost.

All triggered abilities are governed by the following rules:

* Triggered abilities on a card a player controls are optionally triggered (or not) by that player at the appropriate timing moment, as indicated by the ability.
* A triggered ability can only be initiated if its effect has the potential to change the game state, and its cost (if any) has the potential to be paid in full, taking active cost modifiers into account. This potential is assessed without taking into account the consequences of the cost payment or any other ability interactions.
* Once an ability is initiated, players must resolve as much of the effect as possible, unless the effect uses the word “may” (see “May” on page 15).

### Keywords

A keyword is a card ability which conveys specific rules to its card (see “Keywords” on page 13).

### Spawn Instructions and Prey Instructions

Spawn instructions inform where an enemy spawns as it enters play (see “Spawn” on page 19).

Prey instructions inform which investigator an enemy pursues and/or engages if it has a choice (see “Prey” on page 17).

### Action Designators

Some abilities have bold action designators (such as Fight, Evade, Investigate, or Move). Activating such an ability performs the designated action as described in the rules, but modified in the manner described by the ability.

## Act Deck and Agenda Deck

The act deck represents the progress the investigators can make in a scenario. The agenda deck represents the progress and objectives of the dark forces arrayed against the investigators in a scenario. Generally, advancing the act deck is good for the investigators, and advancing the agenda deck is bad for the investigators.

* The act deck advances if the investigators, as a group, spend the requisite number of clues (as indicated by the act card). An act card may indicate a flat value (such as “4”) or a per investigator value (as indicated by the  icon). This is normally done as a  player ability. Any or all investigators may contribute any number of clues towards the total number of clues required to advance the act. If the act has an **“Objective** –” instruction, that instruction overrides or adds additional requirements to the spending of those clues.
* The agenda deck advances if the requisite number of doom is in play (doom on the agenda card as well as doom on any other cards in play), as indicated by the agenda card. An agenda card may indicate a flat value or a per investigator value. If the agenda has an **“Objective** –” instruction, that instruction overrides or adds additional requirements to meeting this doom requirement.
* The act/agenda on top of the act/agenda deck is referred to as the “current” act/agenda.

To advance the act deck or the agenda deck, follow these steps, in order:

1. Remove all tokens from the card to be advanced. If the agenda deck is advancing, remove all doom from each card in play.
2. Flip the advancing card over and follow the instructions on the reverse (“b”) side.
   * If the reverse side of the act or agenda is an encounter card, follow the rules for drawing that encounter cardtype. Otherwise, simply follow the instructions on the card.
3. Sometimes, the advancing act/agenda specifies which card becomes the next act/agenda. If it does not, the next card in the deck becomes the current act/agenda. As a new card becomes the current act/agenda, the advancing card is simultaneously removed from the game.
   * Some instructions in the act and agenda decks (as well as on other encounter cardtypes) contain resolution points, in the format of: “(→R#).” If a resolution point is reached, the scenario ends. Read the designated resolution in the campaign guide.

See also: “Clues” on page 6, “Doom” on page 9.

### Action

During his or her turn, an investigator is permitted to take up to **three** actions. When performing an action, all costs of the action are first paid. Then, the consequences of the action resolve.

* If an investigator is instructed to lose 1 or more actions, he or she has that many fewer actions to take during that round.

For a complete list of the available actions, see section “2.2.1
Investigator takes an action, if able.” on page 24.

### Activate Action

“Activate” is an action an investigator may take during his or her turn in the investigation phase.

When this action is taken, the investigator initiates an ability that specifies one or more  icons as part of its ability cost. The number of  icons in the ability’s cost determines how many actions the investigator is required to use for this activate action. When performing an activate action, all of that action’s costs are simultaneously paid. Then, the consequences of that action resolve.

An investigator is permitted to activate abilities from the following sources:

* A card in play and under his or her control. This includes his or her investigator card.
* A scenario card that is in play and at the same location as the investigator. This includes the location itself, encounter cards placed at that location, and all encounter cards in the threat area of any investigator at that location.
* The current act or current agenda card.
  
### Active Player

The active player is the player taking his or her turn during the investigation phase.

### After

The word “after” refers to the moment immediately after the specified timing point or triggering condition has fully resolved.

*(For example, an ability that reads “After you draw an enemy card” initiates immediately after resolving all of the steps for drawing an enemy—resolving its revelation ability, spawning it, etc.)*

See also: “Ability” on page 2, “Priority of
Simultaneous Resolution” on page 17.

### Agenda Deck

See “Act Deck and Agenda Deck” on page 3.

### Aloof

Aloof is a keyword ability. An enemy with the aloof keyword does not automatically engage investigators at its location.

* When an aloof enemy spawns, it spawns unengaged.
* An investigator may use the engage action or a card ability to engage an aloof enemy.
* An investigator cannot attack an aloof enemy while that enemy is not engaged with an investigator.
  
### Asset Cards

Asset cards represent items, allies, talents, spells, and other reserves that may assist or be used by an investigator during a scenario.

* When you play an asset, it is placed in your play area. Generally, assets remain in play unless discarded by a card ability or game step.
* Some assets have health and/or sanity. When an investigator is dealt damage or horror, that investigator may assign some or all of that damage or horror to eligible asset cards he or she controls (see “Dealing Damage/Horror” on page 7).
* Most assets take up one or more slots while in play (see “Slots” on page 19).
* Some assets have an encounter set icon and no level indicator. Such assets are known as Story Assets. Story Assets are part of an encounter set and may not be included in a player’s deck unless the resolution or setup of a scenario grants that player permission to do so.

### Attach To

If a card uses the phrase “attach to” it must be attached to (placed beneath and slightly overlapped by) the specified game element as it enters play. Once attached, such a card is referred to as an attachment.

* The “attach to” phrase is checked for legality each time a card would be attached to a game element, but is not checked again after that attachment occurs. If the initial “attach to” check does not pass, the card is not able to be attached, and remains in its prior state or game area. If such a card cannot remain in its prior state or game area, discard it.
* Once in play, an attachment remains attached until either the attachment or the game element to which it is attached leaves play (in which case the attachment is discarded), or unless a card ability explicitly detaches the card.
* An attachment exhausts and readies independently of the game element it’s attached to.

### Attacker, Attacked

An “attacker” is an entity (usually an enemy or investigator) that is resolving its attack against another entity. The entity being attacked is referred to as the “attacked enemy” or the “attacked investigator.”

### Attack of Opportunity

Each time an investigator is engaged with one or more ready enemies and takes an action other than to fight, to evade, or to activate a parley or resign ability, each of those enemies makes an attack of opportunity against the investigator, in the order of the investigator’s choosing. Each attack deals that enemy’s damage and horror to the investigator.

* An attack of opportunity is made immediately after all costs of initiating the action that provoked the attack have been paid, but before the application of that action’s effect upon the game state.
* An ability that costs more than one action only provokes one attack of opportunity from each engaged enemy.
* An enemy does not exhaust while making an attack of opportunity.
* After all attacks of opportunity are made, continue with the resolution of the action which instigated the attack.
* Attacks of opportunity count as enemy attacks for the purposes of card abilities.
  
### Automatic Failure/Success

Some card or token abilities may cause a skill test to automatically fail or to automatically succeed. If a skill test automatically fails or automatically succeeds, it does so during step “ST.6” of the “Skill Test Timing” process outlined on page 26.

* If a skill test automatically fails, the investigator’s total skill value for that test is considered 0.
* If a skill test automatically succeeds, the total difficulty of that test is considered 0.

### Base Value

Base value is the value of an element before any modifiers are applied. Unless otherwise specified, the base value of an element derived from a card is the value printed on that card.

### Bearer

The bearer of a weakness is the investigator who started the game with the weakness in his or her deck or play area.
See “Weakness” on page 21.

### Blank

If a card’s printed text box is considered “blank” by an ability, that text box is treated as if it did not have any of its printed content. Text and/or icons gained from another source are not blanked.

* A card’s text box includes: traits, keywords, card text and abilities.

### Campaign Play

A campaign is a series of interrelated scenarios in which each player plays the same investigator from one scenario to the next. As a campaign progresses, the investigator gains experience and trauma, and this is reflected by changes in his or her deck. Each decision made in a campaign may have repercussions in a later scenario.

When starting a campaign, follow the instructions for that campaign’s setup in the campaign guide. After playing through a scenario during a campaign, record the specified results of that scenario in the campaign log.

#### Experience

After recording the results of a scenario, the investigators are ready to reflect on their experiences and purchase new cards for their decks. To do this, follow these steps, in order:

1. Count experience. Each investigator earns experience equal to the total victory value of all cards in the victory display plus or minus any bonuses or penalties indicated by the campaign guide for that resolution. This total is added to any unspent experience an investigator has recorded from previous scenarios in this campaign.
2. Purchase new cards. New cards may be purchased and added to a player’s deck by spending experience equal to the card’s level (denoted by a number of pips in the upper left hand corner of the card). While purchasing new cards, observe the following rules:
   * An investigator’s deckbuilding guidelines (found on the back of the investigator card) must be observed while that investigator is purchasing new cards. Only cards the investigator has access to may be purchased. The deck-size requirement must also be maintained, so that for each (nonpermanent) card purchased and added to a deck, a different card is removed from the deck. Weakness cards and cards that must be included in an investigator’s deck may not be removed while that investigator is purchasing new cards.
   * Each card costs experience equal to the card’s level, to a minimum of 1 (purchasing a level zero card still costs 1 experience). The number of pips beneath a card’s cost indicates the card’s level.
   * When purchasing a higher level version of a card with the same title, the investigator may choose to “upgrade” that card by paying only the difference in experience (to a minimum of 1) between the two cards and removing the lower level version of the card from his or her deck.
   * New cards are purchased (or upgraded) individually. If an investigator wishes to purchase more than 1 copy of a new card, each copy must be paid for separately, and one card must be removed from that investigator's deck for each copy purchased.
   * The above processes, and any specific instructions provided by the campaign guide, are the only methods by which a player may modify his or her deck during a campaign.
3. Record unspent experience. Each investigator records any unspent experience on the campaign log. This experience may be spent at a later time during this campaign.

#### Trauma

Trauma reflects permanent damage that has been done to an investigator’s health and/or psyche.

If an investigator is defeated in a scenario that investigator is eliminated from the scenario but not necessarily from the campaign.

If an investigator is defeated by taking damage equal to his or her health, he or she suffers 1 physical trauma (recorded in the campaign log). For each physical trauma an investigator has, that investigator begins each subsequent scenario in the campaign with 1 damage. If an investigator has physical trauma equal to his or her printed health, the investigator is killed.

If an investigator is defeated by taking horror equal to his or her sanity, he or she suffers 1 mental trauma (recorded in the campaign log). For each mental trauma an investigator has, that investigator begins each subsequent scenario in the campaign with 1 horror. If an investigator has mental trauma equal to his or her printed sanity, the investigator is driven insane.

If an investigator is defeated by simultaneously taking damage equal to his or her health and horror equal to his or her sanity, he or she chooses which type of trauma to suffer.

If an investigator is killed or driven insane, that player must choose a new investigator to use in the next scenario, and creates a new deck for that investigator. Investigators that are killed or driven insane cannot be used for the remainder of the campaign (see “Killed/Insane Investigators” on page 13).

If a player attempts to choose a new investigator and there are no investigators remaining in the pool, the players have lost and the campaign ends.

#### Defeat by Card Ability

An investigator may be defeated by a card ability. A defeated investigator is eliminated from the game (see “Elimination” on page 10). Should this occur, follow the instructions of the card ability to determine if there are any long-term repercussions of the defeat.

#### Advancing to Next Scenario

After completing a scenario, resolving its resolution, updating the campaign log, and purchasing any new cards, advance to the next scenario (sequentially) in the campaign, unless the scenario resolution explicitly directs the investigators to a different scenario.

#### Joining or Leaving a Campaign

Once a campaign has begun, players can freely drop in and out of the campaign in between scenarios.

If a player leaves the campaign, do not delete that player’s information from the campaign log, as he or she may re-join at any time between scenarios.

If a new player joins the campaign, he or she must choose an investigator not previously used during this campaign. That player begins as if it were his or her first scenario in the campaign, with no experience and no trauma.

### Cancel

Some card abilities can “cancel” other card or game effects. Cancel abilities interrupt the initiation of an effect, and prevent the effect from initiating.

* Any time the effects of an ability are canceled, the ability (apart from its effects) is still regarded as initiated, and any costs have still been paid. The effects of the ability, however, are prevented from initiating and do not resolve.
* If the effects of an event card are canceled, the card is still regarded as played, and it is still placed in its owner’s discard pile.
* If the effects of a treachery card are canceled, the card is still regarded as having been drawn, and it is still placed in the encounter discard pile.

### Cannot

The word “cannot” is absolute, and cannot be countermanded by other abilities.

### Cardtypes

The game’s cardtypes are presented in Appendix IV, with detailed card anatomies (see “Appendix IV: Card Anatomy” on page 28).

* If an ability causes a card to change its cardtype, it loses all other cardtypes it might possess and functions as would any card of the new cardtype.

See also: “Asset Cards” on page 4, “Enemy Cards” on page 10, “Event Cards” on page 11, “Location Cards” on page 14, “Skill Cards” on page 18, “Treachery Cards” on page 20.

### Chaos Tokens

Chaos tokens are revealed from the chaos bag during skill tests, to modify or influence the results of the skill test.

   —If any of these tokens are revealed for a skill test, resolve the effect for that symbol as indicated on the scenario reference card for the current scenario.

—This is the auto-fail token. If this token is revealed for a skill test, it indicates the investigator automatically fails the test (see “Automatic Failure/Success” on page 5).

—This is the elder sign token. If this token is revealed
for a skill test, resolve the  effect on the investigator card
belonging to the player performing the skill test.

If a revealed chaos token (or the effect referenced by a chaos token) has a numerical modifier, that modifier is applied to the investigator’s skill value for this test.

See “ST.3 Reveal chaos token.” on page 26.

### Clues

Clues represent the progress the investigators can make towards solving a mystery, unraveling a conspiracy, and/or advancing in a scenario.

* The first time an investigator enters a location, that location is revealed (turned face-up) and a number of clues equal to that location’s clue value are placed on that location (from the token pool). Most clue values are conveyed as a “per investigator ()” value. This may occur during setup.
* A clue at a location can be discovered by successfully investigating the location (see “Investigate Action” on page 13), or by a card ability. If an investigator discovers a clue, he or she takes the clue from the location and places it on his or her investigator card, under his or her control.
* If there are no “Objective – ” requirements for advancing the current act, during any investigator’s turn the investigators may, as a group, spend the requisite number of clues (usually conveyed as a “per investigator” value) from their investigator cards to advance the act deck. This is normally done as a  player ability. Any or all investigators may contribute any number of clues towards the total number of clues required to advance the act.
* A card ability that refers to clues “at a location” is referring to the undiscovered clues that are currently on that location.

See also: [Act Deck and Agenda Deck](#act-deck-and-agenda-deck), “Tokens, Running out of ” on page 20.

### Collection

If an ability refers to a player’s collection *(for example, “search the collection”),* the collection of cards from which that player’s deck was assembled is used.

*Example: Sean and Etienne are each using a deck built from Sean’s collection. If Etienne is instructed to “search the collection,” he searches Sean’s collection.*

### Constant Abilities

See [Ability](#ability).

### Control

See [Ownership and Control](#ownership-and-control).

### Copy

A copy of a card is defined by title. A second copy of a card is any other card that shares the same title, regardless of cardtype, text, artwork, or any other differing characteristics between the cards.

### Costs

There are two types of costs in the game: resource costs and ability costs.

A card’s resource cost is the numerical value that must be paid (in resources) to play the card from hand. To pay a resource cost, an investigator takes the specified number of resources from his or her resource pool and places them in the token pool.

Some triggered card abilities are presented in a “cost: effect” construct. In such a construct, the aspect preceding the colon indicates the ability costs that must be paid and any triggering conditions that must be met to trigger the ability. The aspect following the colon is the effect.

* If multiple costs for a single card or ability require payment, those costs must be paid simultaneously.
* Only the controller of a card or ability may pay its costs. Game elements another player controls may not be used to pay a cost
* When a player is exhausting, sacrificing, or otherwise using cards to pay costs, only cards that are in play and under that player’s control may be used, unless the cost specifies an out-of-play state.
* If a cost requires a game element that is not in play, the player paying the cost may only use game elements that are in his or her game areas (such as his or her hand or deck) to pay the cost.
* If the investigators are instructed to pay a cost as a group, each investigator (or each investigator in the group defined by the ability) may contribute to paying the cost.
* An ability cannot initiate—and therefore its costs cannot be paid—if the resolution of its effect will not change the game state.
* If an investigator takes damage or horror as a cost and reassigns any of it to an asset, the cost is still considered paid.

### Dealing Damage/Horror

There are two types of afflictions that may beset an investigator in the game: damage and horror. Damage afflicts an investigator’s health, and horror afflicts an investigator’s sanity.

When an investigator or enemy is dealt damage and/or horror, follow these steps, in order:

1. **Assign Damage/Horror:** Determine the amount of damage and/or horror being dealt. Place damage and/or horror tokens equal to the amount of damage and horror being dealt next to the cards that will be taking the damage/horror.
   * When an investigator is dealt damage or horror, that investigator may assign it to eligible asset cards he or she controls. To be eligible, an asset card must have health in order to be assigned damage, and it must have sanity in order to be assigned horror.
   * An asset cannot be assigned damage beyond the amount of damage it would take to defeat the card, and cannot be assigned horror beyond the amount of horror it would take to defeat the card.
   * All damage/horror that cannot be assigned to an asset must be assigned to the investigator.
2. **Apply Damage/Horror:** Any assigned damage/horror that has not been prevented is now placed on each card to which it has been assigned, simultaneously. If no damage/horror is applied in this step, no damage/horror has been successfully dealt.
   * Abilities that prevent, reduce, or reassign damage and/or horror that is being dealt are resolved between steps 1 and 2.
   * After applying damage/horror, if an investigator has damage equal to or higher than his or her health or horror equal to or higher than his or her sanity, he or she is defeated. When an investigator is defeated, he or she is eliminated from the scenario (see [Elimination](#elimination)).
   * After applying damage/horror, if an enemy has damage equal to or higher than its health, it is defeated and placed in the encounter discard pile (or in its owner’s discard pile if it is a weakness).
   * After applying damage/horror, if an asset has damage equal to or higher than its health or horror equal to or higher than its sanity, it is defeated and placed in its owner’s discard pile.

### Deck

There are 4 main types of decks that appear in any game: the Investigator Deck, the Encounter Deck, the Act Deck, and the Agenda Deck.

* The order of cards within a deck may not be altered
unless a player is instructed to do so by a card ability.

See also: [Investigator Deck](#investigator-deck), [Encounter Deck](#encounter-deck), [Act Deck and Agenda Deck](#act-deck-and-agenda-deck).

### Deckbuilding

When building a custom deck, the following
guidelines must be observed:

* A player must choose exactly 1 investigator card.
* A player’s investigator deck must include the exact number of player cards indicated on the back of his or her investigator card as the “Deck Size.” Weaknesses, investigator-specific cards, and scenario cards that are added to a player’s deck do not count towards this number.
* A player’s investigator deck may not include more than 2 copies (by title) of any given player card.
* Each standard player card in a player’s investigator deck must be chosen from among the “Deckbuilding Options” available on the back of his or her investigator card.
* Most investigators have 0 experience to spend at the beginning of a campaign, which means that they may only include level 0 cards in their decks. Some investigators, and/or some campaigns, may provide a player with additional experience at the beginning of a campaign, which can be used immediately to purchase higher level cards (see [Campaign Play](#campaign-play)).
* All other “Deckbuilding Requirements” listed on the back of a player’s investigator card must be observed.
* Each required random basic weakness is added to a player’s deck at the end of the deckbuilding process.
* Story Assets may not be included in a player’s deck unless the setup or resolution of a scenario grants that player permission to do so. These assets are indicated by the lack of a card level and the presence of an encounter set symbol (see [Asset Cards](asset-cards])).
* During a campaign, players build a deck before playing the first scenario. In between scenarios, players can purchase new cards or upgrade cards in their deck following the rules found under [Campaign Play](#campaign-play).

#### Classes

Most player cards, including investigators, belong to one of 5 classes.Each class has its own distinct flavor and identity, as described below.

**Guardians** feel compelled to defend humanity, and thus go out of their way to combat the forces of the Mythos. They have a strong sense of duty and selflessness that drives them to protect others, and to hunt monsters down.

**Mystics** are drawn to and influenced by the arcane forces of the Mythos. Many have spell-casting abilities, able to manipulate the forces of the universe through magical talent.

**Rogues** are self-serving and out for themselves. Wily and opportunistic, they are always eager for a way to exploit their current situation.

**Seekers** are primarily concerned with learning more about the world and about the Mythos. They wish to research forgotten lore, map out uncharted areas, and study strange creatures.

**Survivors** are everyday people in the wrong place
at the wrong time, simply trying to survive. Ill-prepared
and ill-equipped, Survivors are the underdogs, who rise
to the occasion when their lives are threatened.

Some cards are not affiliated with any class; these cards are neutral.

Generally, investigators only have access to cards from their class. Some investigators have access to cards from other classes. Refer to the “Deckbuilding Options” on the back of an investigator card to view which cards an investigator has access to.

### Defeat

Taking damage and/or horror may cause an investigator, enemy, or asset to be defeated.

* If an investigator has as much or more damage on it as it has health (or as much or more horror on it as it has sanity), that investigator is defeated. An investigator might also be defeated by a card ability. When an investigator is defeated, he or she is eliminated from the scenario (see “Elimination” on page 10).
* In campaign play, an investigator that is defeated by taking damage equal to his or her health suffers 1 physical trauma. An investigator that is defeated by taking horror equal to his or her sanity suffers 1 mental trauma. Taking trauma may cause an investigator to be killed or driven insane (see “Campaign Play” on page 5 for more information).
* If an enemy has as much or more damage on it as it has health, that enemy is defeated and placed on the encounter discard pile (or on its owner’s discard pile if it is a weakness).
* If an asset with a health value has as much or more damage than it has health, it is defeated. If an asset with a sanity value has as much or more horror than it has sanity, it is defeated. A defeated asset is placed on its owner’s discard pile.

### Delayed Effects

Some abilities create delayed effects. Such abilities specify a future timing point, or indicate a future condition that may arise, and dictate an effect that will happen at that time.

* Each delayed effect initiates automatically and immediately (as a forced ability) if its future timing point or future condition occurs.
* A delayed effect affects all specified entities that are in the specified game area and eligible at the time the delayed effect resolves.

### Difficulty (level)

There are four levels of difficulty in *Arkham Horror: The Card Game*: Easy, Standard, Hard, and Expert. At the beginning of a campaign or standalone scenario, the players choose which difficulty level to use. The campaign setup section of that campaign or scenario’s Campaign Guide indicates which chaos tokens should be placed into the chaos bag when playing on each difficulty level.

* When playing in Easy or Standard mode, use the “Easy/ Standard” side of each scenario’s reference card. When playing in Hard or Expert mode, use the “Hard/Expert” side of each scenario’s reference card instead.

### Difficulty (skill tests)

The difficulty of a skill test is the target number an investigator is trying to equal or exceed with his or her modified skill value to pass that test.

* When attacking an enemy, the base difficulty of the skill test is the enemy’s fight value.
* When investigating a location, the base difficulty of the skill test is the location’s shroud value.
* When attempting to evade an enemy, the base difficulty for the skill test is the enemy’s evade value.
* When resolving a skill test created by a card ability, the base difficulty is indicated as a parenthetical value following the indication of which skill is being tested. For example: *Intellect (3)*.

See “Skill Test Timing” on page 26 for the full rules on skill tests.

### Direct Damage, Direct Horror

If an ability causes a card to take direct damage or direct horror, that damage or horror must be assigned directly to the specified card, and cannot be assigned or re-assigned elsewhere.

### Discard Piles

Any time a card is discarded, it is placed faceup on top of its owner’s discard pile. Encounter cards are owned by the encounter deck.

* Each discard pile is an out-of-play area.
* Each investigator has his or her own discard pile, and the encounter deck has its own discard pile.
* Each discard pile is open information, and may be looked at by any player at any time.
* The order of cards in a discard pile may not be altered unless a player is instructed to do so by a card ability.
* If multiple cards are discarded simultaneously, the owner of the cards may physically place them on top of his or her discard pile one at a time, in any order. If multiple encounter cards are discarded simultaneously, they are placed on top of the encounter discard pile in any order (determined by lead investigator).
* Any ability that would shuffle a discard pile of zero cards back into a deck does not shuffle the deck.

### Doom

Doom represents the progress the forces of the Mythos make towards completing foul rituals, summoning cosmic entities, and/or advancing a scenario’s agenda.

* During each Mythos phase, 1 doom is placed on the current agenda (see “I. Mythos phase” on page 24).
* If there are no “**Objective** – ” requirements for advancing the current agenda and the requisite amount of doom is in play (among the agenda and all cards in play), the agenda advances during the “Check doom threshold” step of the Mythos phase. Unless a card otherwise specifies that it can advance the agenda, this is the only time at which the agenda can advance.
* Doom on cards other than the agenda (such as enemies, allies, locations, etc.) counts towards the amount of doom in play.

See also: “Act Deck and Agenda Deck” on page 3, “Tokens, Running out of ” on page 20.

### Draw Action

“Draw” is an action an investigator may take during his or her turn in the investigation phase.

When an investigator takes this action, that investigator draws one card from his or her deck.

### Drawing Cards

When a player is instructed to draw one or more
cards, those cards are drawn from the top of his or her
investigator deck and added to his or her hand.

When a player is instructed to draw one or more encounter cards, those cards are drawn from the top of the encounter deck, and resolved following the rules for drawing encounter cards under framework step “1.4 Each investigator draws 1 encounter card.” on page 24.

* When a player draws two or more cards as the result of a single ability or game step, those cards are drawn simultaneously. If a deck empties mid-draw, reset the deck and complete the draw.
* There is no limit to the number of cards a player may draw each round.
* If an investigator with an empty investigator deck needs to draw a card, that investigator shuffles his or her discard pile back into his or her deck, then draws the card, and upon completion of the entire draw takes one horror.

### Effects

A card effect is any effect that arises from the resolution of ability text printed on, or gained by, a card. A framework effect is any effect that arises from the resolution of a framework event (see “Framework Event Details” on page 24).

* Card effects may be preceded by costs, triggering conditions, play restrictions, and/or play permissions; such elements are not considered effects (see [Ability](#ability)).
* Once initiated, players must resolve as much of each aspect of the effect as they are able, unless the effect uses the word “may.”
* When a non-targeting effect attempts to interact with a number of entities (such as “draw 3 cards” or “search the top 5 cards of your deck”) that exceeds the number of entities that currently exist in the specified game area, the effect interacts with as many entities as possible.
* The expiration of a lasting effect (or the cessation of a constant ability) is not considered to be generating a game state change by a card effect.
* All aspects of an effect have timing priority over all “after...” triggering conditions that might arise as a consequence of that effect. (For example, if an effect reads “Gain 3 resources and draw 3 cards,” resolve both aspects of the effect (gaining resources and drawing cards) before initiating an ability that reads “After drawing a card...”)

See also: [Delayed Effects](#delayed-effects), “Lasting Effects” on page 14, “Priority of Simultaneous Resolution” on page 17.

### Elimination

A player is eliminated from a scenario any time his or her investigator is defeated, or if he or she resigns. The only manner in which eliminated investigators interact with the game when establishing “per investigator” values (see page 16). Any time a player is eliminated:

0. For the purpose of resolving weakness cards, the game has ended for the eliminated investigator. Trigger any “when the game ends” abilities on each weakness the eliminated investigator owns that is in play. Then, remove those weaknesses from the game.
1. The cards he or she controls in play and all of the cards in his or her out-of-play areas (such as hand, deck, discard pile) are removed from the game.
   * Any card that player owns but does not control that is in play remains in play, but if that card leaves play it is removed from the game.
2. All clue tokens that player possesses are placed at the location the investigator was at when he or she was eliminated, and all of that player’s resource tokens are returned to the token pool.
3. All enemies engaged with that player are placed at the location the investigator was at when he or she was eliminated, unengaged but otherwise maintaining their current game state.
4. All other cards in the eliminated investigator’s threat area are placed in the appropriate discard pile.
5. If the lead investigator is eliminated, the remaining players (if any) choose a new lead investigator.
6. If there are no remaining players, the scenario ends. Refer to “no resolution was reached” entry for that scenario in the campaign guide.

### Empty Location

An empty location is a location with no enemies or investigators at it.

### Encounter Deck

The encounter deck contains the encounter cards (enemy, treachery, and story asset cards) the investigators may encounter during a scenario.

* If the encounter deck is empty, shuffle the encounter discard pile back into the encounter deck.

### Encounter Set

An encounter set is a collection of encounter cards, denoted by a common encounter set symbol near each card’s cardtype.

### Enemy Cards

Enemies represent villains, cultists, ne’er-do-wells, terrible monsters, and unfathomable entities from alternate dimensions or the cosmos beyond.

When an enemy card is drawn by an investigator, that investigator must spawn it following any spawn direction the card bears (see “Spawn” on page 19). If the encountered enemy has no spawn direction, the enemy spawns engaged with the investigator encountering the card and is placed in that investigator’s threat area.

See “1.4 Each investigator draws 1 encounter card.” on page 24.

* A ready, unengaged enemy engages any time it is at the same location as an investigator (see “Enemy Engagement” on page 10).
* If an investigator is engaged with a ready enemy and takes an action other than to **fight**, to **evade**, or to activate a **parley** or **resign** ability, that enemy makes an attack of opportunity (see [Attack of Opportunity](#attack-of-opportunity)).
* Enemies with the hunter keyword move during the Enemy Phase (see “III. Enemy phase” on page 25).
* Engaged enemies attack during the Enemy Phase (see “III. Enemy phase” on page 25).

### Enemy Engagement

While an enemy card is in play, it is either engaged with an investigator (and placed in that investigator’s threat area), or it is unengaged and at a location (and placed at that location). Each enemy in an investigator’s threat area is considered to be at the same location as that investigator, and should the investigator move, the enemy remains engaged and moves to the new location simultaneously with the investigator.

Any time a ready unengaged enemy is at the same location as an investigator, it engages that investigator, and is placed in that investigator’s threat area. If there are multiple investigators at the same location as a ready unengaged enemy, follow the enemy’s prey instructions to determine which investigator is engaged. There is no limit on the number of enemies that can be engaged with a single investigator.

*For example, a ready unengaged enemy immediately engages if:*

* *It spawns at the same location as an investigator,*
* *It moves into the same location as an investigator,*
* *An investigator moves into the same location as it.*

An exhausted unengaged enemy does not engage, but if an exhausted enemy at the same location as an investigator becomes ready, it engages as soon as it is readied.

* *Note: An enemy with the Aloof keyword does not
engage in the manner described above.*

### Enemy Phase

See “III. Enemy phase” on page 25.

Engage Action
“Engage” is an action an investigator may take during
his or her turn in the investigation phase.
To engage an enemy at the same location (for example,
this could be done to engage an exhausted enemy, an aloof
enemy, or an enemy engaged with another investigator), an
investigator places the chosen enemy in his or her threat
area. The investigator and the enemy are now engaged.
=An investigator may perform the engage action to engage
an enemy that is engaged with a different investigator
at the same location. The enemy simultaneously
disengages from the previous investigator and
engages the investigator performing the action.
=An investigator cannot use the engage action to engage
an enemy he or she is already engaged with.
Enters Play
The phrase “enters play” refers to any time a card makes
a transition from an out-of-play area into a play area
(see “In Play and Out of Play” on page 13).
=If an ability (either on the card itself or from another
card) causes a card to enter play in a state different
from that specified by the rules, there is no transition
to that state. It merely enters play in that state.
Evade, Evade Action
“Evade” is an action an investigator may take during
his or her turn in the investigation phase.
To evade an enemy engaged with an investigator, that
investigator makes an agility test against the enemy’s
evade value (see “Skill Tests” on page 18).
If the test is successful, the investigator successfully evades
the enemy (see below). (This occurs during step 7 of the skill
test, per “ST.7 Apply skill test results.” on page 26.)
If the test fails, the investigator does not evade the
enemy, and it remains engaged with him or her.
=If an ability “automatically” evades 1 or more enemies,
no skill test is made for the evasion attempt.
=Any time an enemy is evaded (whether by an evade action,
or by card ability), the enemy is exhausted (if it was ready)
and the engagement is broken. Move the enemy from the
investigator’s threat area to the investigator’s location to
mark that it is no longer engaged with that investigator.
=Unlike the fight and engage action, an investigator
can only perform an evade action against
an enemy engaged with him or her.
Event Cards
Event cards represent tactical actions, maneuvers, spells, tricks,
and other instantaneous effects at a player’s disposal.
=If an event card does not have the fast keyword, it may
only be played from a player’s hand by performing a
“Play” action during his or her turn. You must follow
all play permissions/restrictions that card has.
=A fast event card may be played from a player’s hand any time
its play instructions specify (see “Fast” on page 11).
=Any time a player plays an event card, its costs are paid, its
effects are resolved (or canceled), and the card is placed in its
owner’s discard pile after those effects resolve (or are canceled).
=If the effects of an event card are canceled, the card
is still considered to have been played, and its costs
remain paid. Only the effects have been canceled.
=Playing an event card from hand (or not playing
it) is always optional for a player, unless the event
uses the word “must” in its play instructions.
=An event card cannot be played unless the resolution of
its effect has the potential to change the game state.
Exceptional
Exceptional is a deckbuilding keyword ability.
=A card with the exceptional keyword costs twice
its printed experience cost to purchase.
= A player’s investigator deck cannot include more than
1 copy (by title) of any given exceptional card.
Exhaust, Exhausted
Occasionally, a card ability or game step will cause a card to exhaust to
indicate it has been used to perform a function. When a card exhausts,
it is rotated 90 degrees. A card in this state is said to be exhausted.
=An exhausted card cannot exhaust again until it is
ready (typically by a game step or card ability).
Experience
See “Campaign Play” on page 5.
Fast
Fast is a keyword ability. A fast card does not cost an action
to be played and is not played using the “Play” action.
=A fast event card may be played from a player’s hand any
time its play instructions specify. If the instructions specify
when/after a timing point, the card may be played as if
the described timing point were a triggering condition for
playing the card. If the instructions specify a duration or
period of time, the card may be played during any player
window within that period. If the instructions specify both
a when/after timing point and a duration or period of time,
the card may be played in reference to any instance of the
specified triggering condition within that time period.
=A fast asset may be played by an investigator
during any player window on his or her turn.
=Because fast cards do not cost actions to play,
they do not provoke attacks of opportunity (see
“Attack of Opportunity” on page 5).
