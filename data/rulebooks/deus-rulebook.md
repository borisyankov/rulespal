# Deus Rulebook

## Table of Contents

As the leader of an ancient civilization, explore unknown lands in order to develop your empire.

Found new cities and construct buildings in order to exploit natural resources, establish trade routes. Set out to conquer barbarian villages or increase your scientific knowledge.

Don’t forget to maintain good standing with the Gods!

Pay tribute to them by making offerings and by building fabulous temples.

## Overview and Goal of the Game

Each player begins a game of Deus with a hand of 5 Building cards. On your turn, you must choose from two actions: **construct a building** or **make an offering to a god**.

Constructing a building consists of playing a Building card, and placing the associated wooden piece in a region of the gameboard. You must place the building card in the column of the same color, and then you can benefit from the power of all the cards placed in this column, starting at the bottom. The powers of buildings allow you to gain victory points, resources, or money, make scientific advancements, or attack your neighbors. It is also possible to construct a temple, which provides victory points at the end of the game.

Making an offering to a god consists of discarding cards in order to receive aid from the god associated with one of these cards. Then you draw cards until you have five cards in your hand again.

Two things can end the game:

* All the barbarian villages have been attacked
* All the temples have been built

The player with the most victory points (VP) wins the game.

* **96 building cards** (16 civil buildings, 16 scientific buildings, 16 maritime buildings, 16 military units, 16 production buildings, 16 temples)
* **100 wooden Buildings** (25 per player):
  * 5 civil buildings
  * 5 scientific buildings
  * 5 maritime buildings
  * 5 military units
  * 5 production buildings
* **7 wooden Temples** in a neutral color
* **7 two-sided Continent tiles**
* **Gold coins** (63 ones, 12 fives, 9 tens)
* **Victory Point tokens** (24 ones, 9 threes, 9 fives, 17 tens)
* **80 resources:** wood (20), stone (20), clay (20), wheat (20)
* **1 First Player card**

## Building Cards and Corresponding Wooden Pieces

Each card in the game represents a building. There are 6 different types of building, easily identifiable by the color and the symbol associated with the card. Each type of building also corresponds to a wooden Building in the player color of its owner (except Temples).

*Note: For convenience, we will call all wooden pieces “buildings”, including the ships and meeples.*

## Continent Tiles, Regions, and Corresponding Resources

The Continent tiles form the gameboard. Each tile is comprised of 2 sea regions, 1 barbarian village and 4 land regions. Each land region is associated with 1 resource, uniquely produced in that type of terrain (see Card Effects and Clarifications):

* Fields produce wheat.
* Forests produce wood.
* Swamps produce clay.
* Mountains produce stone.

## Setup

1. Form the gameboard from the continent tiles. The number of tiles and their relative positions varies depending on the number of players:

   * 2 players : 4 tiles
   * 3 players : 6 tiles
   * 4 players : 7 tiles

2. On each barbarian village, place as many VP as the number of regions adjacent to it.

3. Form a **general supply**, containing the following:

   * As many **Temple pieces** as there are Continent tiles (4 with 2 players, 6 with 3 players, 7 with 4 players).
   * 5 resources of each type (wheat, stone, clay, wood) per player (10 resources of each type with 2 players, 15 with 3 players, and 20 with 4 players).
   * The **victory points** (VP).
   * The **gold pieces**.

   *Note: Return any unused Temple pieces and Resource tokens to the box. During the game, players can no longer gain a resource that has run out. The VP and gold pieces, on the other hand, are unlimited. Players VP are hidden.*

4. Each player takes **1 player board** and **the Building pieces** in their color. Place 2 pieces of each type on the corresponding column of your player board. Set the rest of the pieces beside your player board to form a personal supply.

5. Each player takes **5 gold coins, 4 resources** (1 stone, 1 clay, 1 wheat, 1 wood), and **5 VP**. The resources come from the general supply.

6. Thoroughly shuffle the 96 **Building cards** and deal 5 to each player before forming a draw pile with the remaining cards.

7. Choose a first player and give them the **First Player card**.

## Gameplay

The game lasts a variable number of rounds. Each round, players take turns in clockwise order, starting with the First Player. On your turn, you must choose 1 of the following 2 actions:

**A. Construct a building**  
**B. Make an offering to the gods**

### A. Construct a building

In order to construct building, you must first play a Building card from your hand. Note that there are two different types of building: standard and temples.

#### Standard Buildings

In order to construct a standard building (civil buildings, scientific buildings, maritime buildings, military units, production buildings) from your hand, you must follow these steps:

1. Verify that you have at least one wooden piece of the same type on your player board. If you do not have a piece of this type, you cannot play this card.
2. Place the card above your player board. Your player board establishes 6 columns by color. Place the card at the top of the column of the same color, such that the effects of all cards in that column are visible.
3. Pay the construction cost indicated in the upper-left corner of the card. You can pay in resources and/or gold.

   **Important: When paying the construction cost (and only in that case) each resource can be replaced by 4 Gold (even if the player has this resource).**

4. Place the wooden Building corresponding to the card in a region on the gameboard. This piece must come from your player board. Placement of the piece must respect the following placement rules:

   * You must place your first Building in a region at the edge of the gameboard. The first regions occupied by each player must be separated by at least two empty regions, if possible.
   * Your subsequent Buildings can be constructed in either a region that you control, or an empty region adjacent to a region that you control. If you place a wooden Building in a region that you control, you must respect this fundamental rule: Each Building in a single region must be of a different type (for example, two civil buildings can never be placed in the same region).
   * You cannot construct a building in a region occupied by a barbarian village (even if there are no longer any VP on this village).
   * Maritime buildings (represented by ships) must be constructed in a sea region. The other buildings cannot be constructed in sea regions.
   * If you wish, you may place a Building in an empty region at the edge of the gameboard in exchange for 3 VP. This can be useful in certain situations; for example, if you are blocked in.

5. Benefit from the effects of all the cards in the column where you just placed the card. You must activate the cards from bottom to top. Each card’s effect is depicted both with icons and with text.

#### Temples

In order to construct a temple from your hand, you must follow these
steps:

1. If you are building your first temple, place the card in the notch in the right end of your player board.

2. In order to construct your 2nd temple, you must have 1 card of each color on your Player Board. In order to construct your 3rd temple, you must have 2 cards of each color on your Player board , and so on.

3. Pay the construction cost indicated in the upper-left corner of the card, which is always 1 resource of each type. Because it is a construction cost, each resource could be replaced by 4 Gold. The constructed temple provides VP (12 VP maximum per temple) at the end of the game, according to its effect.

4. Place a wooden temple from the general supply in one of your regions (not in an empty region). As with the other types of building, you cannot have more than one temple in a city. The temple is recognized as a standard building for card effects that depend on the number of buildings in a region.

   *Note: If you build your temple in a region comprising only a military building (an army), you will not be able to move the army until you build another building in that city. You are not allowed to abandon a temple.*

**Important: Unlike the other buildings, it is still possible to play a Temple card if the temple supply is empty. In this case, you simply do not place a wooden temple on the gameboard.**

#### Attack a Barbarian Village

It is possible to attack a barbarian village after having placed a building on the gameboard. This attack happens **immediately** (the round pauses until the attack is resolved) when both of the the following conditions are met:

* Players occupy all the regions adjacent to the village.
* There is at least one army in those adjacent regions.

When this happens, the village is attacked by the player who has the most armies in regions adjacent to the barbarian village. The attacker simply wins the VP placed on the barbarian village. From now on, the region is no longer considered to be a barbarian village for card effects that depend on this. In the case of a tie, the tied player who has constructed more buildings in those regions wins the VP. If it is still a tie, the tied players share the VP, rounding down.

**Important: If at the end of your action, you no longer have cards in your hand, you automatically draw 5 new ones. Whenever the Building card deck is empty, shuffle the discards to create a new deck.**

### B. Make an offering to the gods

An offering allows you to discard cards in order to invoke one of the 6 gods, and to draw new cards to replenish your hand to 5 again. In order to make an offering, you must follow these steps:

1. Discard as many of the cards from your hand as you wish, and announce how many you are discarding (you can keep some of your cards, as long as you discard at least 1 card).

2. Place the cards face-up in the discard (the other players will know only what the topmost card is, not the others).

3. Benefit from the power of the god associated with the topmost card on the discard. The god’s powers are depicted on your player board. The magnitude of the power is proportional to the number of cards that you discard. The gods also allow you to take wooden pieces from the general supply and place them on your player board.

4. Draw cards from the deck in order to replenish your hand to 5 cards. If you invoked Minerva (yellow/scientific), draw one more card per card you discarded in Step 3 above.

**Important: It is never possible to have more than 10 cards in your hand. If you have the ability to draw beyond the 10th card, you must stop drawing when you have 10 cards in your hand.**

*Note: If you have more than 5 cards before starting this step you do not need to discard down to a hand of 5 cards, you will simply have more than 5 cards in your hand.*

#### Neptune (blue/maritime)

Gain 2 gold per discarded card. Also gain 1 wooden maritime building.

#### Ceres (green/production)

Gain 1 resource of your choice per discarded card (You may choose resources that you do not produce). Also gain 1 wooden production building.

#### Minerva (yellow/scientific)

Gain 1 wooden scientific building. You can draw 1 additional card in Step 4 (see below) per discarded card.

#### Vesta (brown/civil)

Gain 1 VP if you have discarded 1 card; 2 VP (total) if you have discarded more than 1. Also gain 1 wooden civil building.

#### Mars (red/military)

Gain 1 wooden building of your choice per discarded card. You do not have to take a military building.

#### Jupiter (purple/temple)

Use the power of one of the 5 other gods. Jupiter acts as a “wild”. You can only invoke one god per offering.

## End of the game

The end of the game is triggered when either of the two following conditions is met:

* All the temples from the general supply have been constructed.
* All the barbarian villages have been attacked.

When one of these conditions is met, finish the current round, so that all players get a equal number of turns. Then play a final round, during which each player can choose one final action.

Now each player tallies up their VP by adding:

* VP won during the game.
* Points awarded by their constructed temples (12 VP maximum per temple).
* For each type of resource (wheat, wood, stone, clay) and gold, check to see which player has the most (it must be at least 1). That player receives 2 VP. If there’s a tie, each tied player gets the 2 VP.

## Card Effects and Clarifications

### Blue Cards (Maritime)

*Blue cards are associated with maritime buildings, which are the only wooden pieces playable on the sea regions. Trade allows you to sell resources for gold or VP. These cards also allow you to buy resources, or exchange them with the general supply.*

Clarifications:

* You can never play 2 maritime buildings on the same sea region.
* It is possible that you cannot play a blue card because you have no access to the sea.
* It is possible that nobody can play a blue card because all sea regions are occupied.
* Sold resources are returned to the general supply.
* The resources purchased are taken from the general supply.

### Green Cards (Production)

*The production buildings produce the 4 types of resources that will be necessary for building construction and for trade.*

Clarification:

* A building produces only the resource associated with the region in which it is built. The way it is produced is described by the card effect.

### Yellow Cards (Scientific)

*Scientific cards allow you to neglect the gods and to no longer have to make an offering. Indeed, certain cards allow you to draw cards, and others allow you to gain wooden pieces from the general supply. Science also allows you to activate cards of other colors.*

Clarifications:

* You can never have more than 10 cards in your hand.
* When you gain pieces, choose freely from among the 5 types of building (but not temples), and place the piece on the appropriate space of your player board.

### Brown Cards (Civil)

*Civil cards allow you to gain VP or money, depending on your development. Half of the cards reward you based on the size of your cities; the other half reward you based on the terrain type on which you have built.*

### Red Cards (Military)

*Military cards allow you to attack your opponents by stealing their gold or VP. Military units are also the only buildings you can move, which you do by using the effects of certain cards. In addition, you will need military units to attack the barbarian villages.*

Clarifications:

* To save space on the military cards, we used shorter terms: army means «military unit» and ship means «maritime building».
* Moving a military unit 1 region allows you to move the military unit into an adjacent region.
* A military unit can move through regions occupied by opponents, and through barbarian villages, as long as it doesn’t end its move there.
* A military unit may enter and stop in a sea region if one of your maritime buildings is there. You can never enter a sea region occupied by an enemy maritime building.
* There can never be two military units in the same area at the end of a turn.

## Variants

### Alternative Start

Instead of starting with 2 buildings of each type, each of you secretly chooses a total of 10 buildings, which you place in the corresponding columns of your player board. Put the rest of the buildings in your personal supply, just as in the basic game. Experienced players can start the game with 8 or 9 buildings, instead of 10. Expert players can start with 6 or 7 buildings.

### Alternative Gameboard Setups

You can modify the arrangement of the Continent tiles at the start of the game, inspired by the following examples or however you like. Just make sure that the number of tiles corresponds correctly to the number of players (4 tiles with 2 players, 6 with 3 players, and 7 with 4 players), and that there are never 2 barbarian villages adjacent to one another.

### Building Wildcard

This variant is designed for players who wish to reduce the luck of the draw a little. Once per game, you can choose the construct a building action without having to consider the color of the Building card you are playing. You must play the card face-down, without showing it to the other players, and place it in the column of whichever color you wish. The construction cost is 1 gold if the card is the first card in the column, 2 gold if it is the second, 3 gold if it is the third, etc. This card grants you no effects, but it allows you to construct a building and to activate the effects of the other cards in its column. This card also counts as one of the cards necessary for the construction of a temple; however, you cannot use this card to construct the temple itself.
