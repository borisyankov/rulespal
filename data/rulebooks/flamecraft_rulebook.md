# Flamecraft Rulebook

## Table of Contents

## Welcome to Town!

Artisan dragons are creative little crafters who spout specialized flames to help them create a variety of tasty or helpful goods. They are highly sought-after by shopkeepers who hope to draw in and delight customers with their Flamecraft.

You are a Flamekeeper, skilled in the art of conversing with dragons, placing them in their ideal homes and casting enchantments to entice them to produce wondrous things.

Your reputation will grow as you aid the dragons and shopkeepers, and the Flamekeeper with the greatest reputation will be known as the Master of Flamecraft!

## Setup

1. TOWN & STARTER SHOPS
   * Roll out the **Town mat** in the middle of the table.
   * Place the **6 Starter Shops** faceup on any 6 Shop spaces in Town.
   * Place each **Starter Artisan Dragon** faceup on the Shop with the **matching icon** in the top left, so that the Dragon covers the first **slot** along the bottom of the Shop.

3. SHOP DECK
   * Sort the Shop cards into piles based on the **icons** in the top left corner. Make 1 pile for each of the **6 Goods icons** and a 7th pile for **all other icons**.
   * Flip the 7 piles **facedown** and separately shuffle them. Take **1** card from **each** of the **Goods Shop** piles, and **4** cards from the **7th pile**, to make a facedown stack of **10 Shops**.
   * This is the **Shop deck**. Shuffle the Shop deck and place it to the side of the Town mat.  
     *Once you’re familiar with the game, feel free to vary the composition of the Shop deck however you like.*
4. ARTISAN DRAGONS
   * If you are playing with **2 or 3 players**, remove the following Artisan Dragon cards from the deck:
      * 2 players - Remove **12 Dragons** (2 of each Goods type).

7. PLAYER SETUP
   * Each player chooses a **player token** (dragon) and takes the matching-color **Reputation marker** (heart) and **player aid** card. Return all unused player components to the box.
   * Gather the **Reputation markers** together and randomly reveal one of them to choose the **first player**. Then place all Reputation markers near the start of the **Reputation track**.

   * Deal each player **2 Fancy Dragons**. Each player chooses **1** Fancy Dragon to keep and returns the Fancy Dragon they did **not** choose to the bottom of the Fancy deck.
   * If playing with **4+ players**, the 4th and 5th players each take a **Goods token** of their choice to start.

*You can keep your Artisan Dragons and Fancy Dragons a secret until you play them. However, the number you have of each is public information.*

## Overview

Your goal is to become the most storied and successful Flamekeeper in town! Grow your **Reputation** by visiting Shops to place **Artisan Dragons**, cast **Enchantments**, and satisfy the goals of your secret **Fancy Dragons**.

Players take turns in clockwise order, starting with the **first player** chosen at setup. On each player’s turn, they must move to a new **Shop**, then decide whether to gather **Goods** or cast an **Enchantment** there. Play continues until the **Artisan deck** or **Enchantment deck** runs out (see “[End of the Game](#end-of-the-game)”).

At the end of the game, the player who is furthest ahead on the **Reputation track** wins!

### Taking a Turn

On your turn, you must **visit a Shop**, then choose to either **Gather** or **Enchant** there.

At the end of your turn, you must check whether to **expand the Town**, then **discard down** to your Dragons and Goods limit and **refresh** the faceup Enchantments and Artisan Dragons.

The following sections provide detail on each turn step.

### Visiting a Shop

At the start of your turn, choose a Shop anywhere in Town and move your player token onto the Shop card. You must choose a **different** Shop than you visited on your last turn.

In order to move to a Shop that **other players** are visiting, you must give **each** of them **1 Good** of your choice (or 1 Coin) from your personal supply. If you don’t have enough Goods (or Coins) to give 1 to each player, you must choose a different Shop to visit.

## Gathering from a Shop

If you choose to **Gather** from the Shop you visit, follow these steps **in order**:

1. **GATHER GOODS:** Gain Goods, Coins, and Dragons from the Shop and from each Artisan Dragon and Enchantment there.
2. **(OPTIONAL) PLACE A DRAGON:** You may place 1 Artisan Dragon from your hand into a Dragon slot with a matching icon, then gain the rewards on that slot.
3. **(OPTIONAL) FIRE UP A DRAGON:** You may use the fire up ability of any 1 Artisan Dragon at the Shop.
4. **(OPTIONAL) USE SHOP ABILITY:** You may use the Shop’s ability, if it has one.

### 1. Gather Goods

When you Gather from a Shop, you gain **1 Good**, **Coin**, or **Artisan Dragon** offered by the Shop, and **1 Good** from each **Artisan Dragon** and **Enchantment** at the Shop.

The **icon** in the **top left corner** of each card tells you **what it gives you**:

* Gain a **Good** matching this icon.
* Gain a **Good** of your choice.
* Gain a **Coin**.
* Draw an **Artisan Dragon** of your choice from the Park or the top of the deck.

Take any **Goods** and/or **Coins** you gain from the appropriate piles and place them in a **personal supply** visibly in front of you. If a general pile runs out, you may use a suitable replacement. Add any Artisan Dragons you gain to your **hand**.

*Coins are not Goods, so when you gain Goods of your choice, you may not choose to gain Coins.*

### 2. Place a Dragon

Once you’ve gathered Goods, you **may** place **1 Artisan Dragon** from your hand into any **empty Dragon slot** at the Shop.

In order to place a Dragon at a Shop, the Dragon’s **icon** (in the top left corner) must **match** one of the icons on the **empty slot** where you want to place it. A Shop’s slots may be filled in **any order** (they do **not** have to be filled from left to right).

After placing your Dragon, gain the printed **rewards** on
the slot you filled (see “Earning Rewards” below).

If a Dragon slot has **multiple** icons, you may place a Dragon matching any of those icons. If a slot has a wild icon, you may place a Dragon with **any** icon.

#### Earning Rewards

Players can earn a variety of **rewards** throughout the game by placing Artisan Dragons, Enchanting Shops, and fulfilling the goals of Fancy Dragons.

**GAIN REPUTATION:** Score this much Reputation by advancing your marker on the Reputation track.

**DRAW A FANCY DRAGON:** Draw a new Fancy Dragon from the deck (see “[Fancy Dragons](#fancy-dragons)”).

**DRAW AN ARTISAN DRAGON:** Draw a faceup Artisan Dragon from the Park or the top of the deck.

**GAIN COINS:** Gain this many Coins. Coins can be spent or gifted as **any Good** when paying for an action (they are **wild**).

*Unspent Coins are worth 1 reputation each at the end of the game.*

#### Filling a Shop

If at any point during your turn you place an Artisan Dragon in the **last empty slot** at a Shop, you must draw a **new Shop** from the deck, **without looking at it**, and place it **facedown** on any empty spot in Town (it doesn’t matter which empty spot). At the **end of your turn**, you will **reveal** each new Shop you drew to **expand the Town**.

Certain abilities may let you fill a different shop that the one you are currently at (or even multiple Shops in one turn).

*There are a limited number of town spaces. 12 in a 1-2 player game, with shops up to 14 possible in 3-5 player games, using marked spaces near the park. If town is full, ignore ‘Filling a Shop’ above.*

### 3. Fire Up A Dragon

Each Artisan Dragon has a **fire up** ability. All Dragons with the same **icon** have the same ability. (These abilities are covered in detail under “[Abilities](#abilities)”)

When you Gather from a Shop, you may use the fire up ability of **any 1** Artisan Dragon at the Shop. This may be a Dragon you placed, or a Dragon that was already there when you visited.

### 4. Use Shop Ability

Some Shops have special **Shop abilities** printed on them. As the **last** step of Gathering from a Shop, you **may** use the Shop’s special ability.

*You may only use a Shop’s ability when you Gather from it, **not** when you Enchant it.*

#### Giving Gifts

Some abilities allow you to **gift** Goods, Coins, or cards to **other players** to earn Reputation or other rewards.

Whenever you give gifts, take the indicated items from **your personal supply** and distribute them among other players however you like (unless noted otherwise). You may gift **Coins** in place of Goods.

If an ability grants a reward for gifting other than Reputation, this comes from the general supply, not from the player who received the gift.

## Enchanting a Shop

If you decide to **Enchant** the Shop you visit, follow these steps **in order**:

1. **CAST ENCHANTMENT:** Choose an Enchantment card from the faceup row that matches the Shop’s icon. Pay its Goods cost to tuck it behind the Shop and gain the rewards on it.
2. **(OPTIONAL) FIRE UP ALL DRAGONS:** You may use the fire up abilities of any number of Artisan Dragons at the Shop.

In order to Enchant the Shop you visit, you must be able to **cast an Enchantment** there (there must be a **faceup Enchantment** that matches the Shop’s icon, and you must be able to pay its **cost**; see “[Cast an Enchantment](#1-cast-an-enchantment)”).

### 1. Cast an Enchantment

To **Enchant** a Shop, choose **1 Enchantment card** from the **faceup row** that **matches** the Shop’s **icon** (the Enchantment has the same icon in its **top left corner** as the Shop does). Then **cast** the Enchantment by paying the **Goods** shown on it, returning them to the appropriate piles.

You may pay **Coins** in place of any Goods (unless the Enchantment has a no coins icon). If you spend multiple Coins, you may spend each of them as a **different Good**, if desired.

Once you’ve paid the cost, gain the **rewards** shown at the bottom of the card (see “[Earning Rewards](#earning-rewards)”), then **tuck** the Enchantment behind the Shop (so players can easily see that the Shop now produces **1 additional Good**).

Enchantments you take from the faceup row are not replaced
until the end of your turn (see “[Ending Your Turn](#ending-your-turn)”).

### 2. Fire Up *ALL* Dragons

After you Enchant a Shop, you **may** use the fire up ability of **each** Artisan Dragon there, in any order.

If firing up an Artisan Dragon lets you place **a new Dragon** at the Shop, you may **also** fire up that Dragon.

### Enchantment Clarifications

#### DRAGON & COIN SHOPS

Shops with a dragon or coin icon cannot be Enchanted, since there are no Enchantments with those icons.

#### ENCHANTMENT LIMIT

A Shop can have **no more than 3 Enchantments** on it. (There are only **3 Enchantments** with **each icon** in the deck, so most Shops can’t exceed this limit anyway.)

#### WILD SHOPS

If a Shop has a wild icon, **any** Enchantment can be cast there. Wild Shops can still only have **3 Enchantments**, regardless of icon.

#### NO COINS

A no coins symbol means you may **not** spend **any** Coins to pay the cost of this Enchantment.

#### VARIABLE REWARDS

Some Enchantments show a **set of Goods** that can be paid **multiple times** to increase your reward.

*You can cast a variable Enchantment by paying **only 1 set** of the required Goods, but yo
u will get 0 reputation.*

### Reserving Enchantments

Some abilities allow you to **reserve** an Enchantment. When you do this, take an Enchantment of your choice from the row and put it faceup in front of you. (Remember not to refill the row until the end of your turn.)

When Enchanting a Shop, you may cast your reserved Enchantment instead of an Enchantment from the faceup row. Other players may **not** cast your reserved Enchantment. You are limited to **1 reserved Enchantment** at a time. If you currently have a reserved Enchantment, you **can’t** reserve another one.

## Ending Your Turn

After Gathering or Enchanting, take the following steps to clean up for the next player’s turn:

1. **EXPAND TOWN:** Flip any new Shops you drew during your turn faceup.
2. **DRAGONS & GOODS LIMIT:** Return Dragons and Goods until you have no more than 6 Artisan Dragons and 7 Goods of each type.
3. **REFRESH PARK & ENCHANTMENTS:** Draw new faceup Artisan Dragons and Enchantments until there are 5 of each.

### 1. Expand Town

If you filled any Shops on your turn and drew new ones, flip these new Shops **faceup**. They are now available for players to visit.

### 2. Dragons & Goods Limit

At the end of your turn, you may have no more than **6 Artisan Dragons** in your hand. If you do, you must return Dragons of your choice to the bottom of the Artisan deck until you have 6.

Additionally, you may have no more than **7 tokens** of each **Goods type**. If you have more than 7 of any type, you must return tokens to the appropriate piles until you have 7.

*There is no limit to the number of Coins and Fancy Dragons you can have. These do not need to be counted at the end of your turn.*

### 3. Refresh Park & Enchantments

If there are **fewer than 5** faceup Artisan Dragons or Enchantments, reveal new cards from the appropriate decks until there are 5 each. If the Artisan deck or Enchantment deck runs out, this triggers the **end of the game** (see “[End of the Game](#end-of-the-game)”).

*Artisan Dragons and Enchantments you take during your turn are not replaced until the **end** of your turn.*

## End of the Game

When the **last card** in either the **Artisan deck** or **Enchantment deck** is drawn or revealed, this triggers the end of the game. Each player gets **1 final turn**, including the player who triggered the game end.

Once all players have had a final turn, players gain **end-game Reputation** as follows:

1. **LEFTOVER COINS:** Each player returns all Coins in their supply to the Fountain and gains 1 reputation per returned Coin.
2. **FANCY DRAGONS:** Each player reveals each Fancy Dragon with a moon icon whose goals they’ve fulfilled and scores the indicated amount of reputation.

Whoever has the highest Reputation score wins!

*You must turn in all your Coins **before** scoring your Fancy Dragons. This means you **can’t** use Coins to fulfill your Fancy Dragons’ goals.*

### Tiebreakers

In the case of a tie, the tied player with the most **Artisan Dragons** left in their **hand** wins. If still tied, the tied player with the most leftover **Goods** in their supply wins. If still tied, they share a well-deserved victory!

## Fancy Dragons

*These unique Dragons are attracted to the activities of Flamekeepers and use their abilities to add flair and flamboyance to the lives of those they follow. Some of them can be seen celebrating during daylight hours, while others wait until night for their festivities.*

Each player starts the game with 1 Fancy Dragon, and can draw more as **rewards** or by using **abilities**. There is no limit to the number of Fancy Dragons you can have.

Each Fancy Dragon has a specific **goal**. If you fulfill a Fancy Dragon’s **goal**, it will shower you with **Reputation** and other rewards.

### SUN DRAGONS

These Fancy Dragons can only be scored **during the
game**. If you have fulfilled a Sun Dragon’s goal, you may
reveal it **at any time on your turn** to gain its rewards. If
its goal requires you to spend **Goods**, return these to the
appropriate piles.

*You can only score each of your Sun Dragons once per game. Leave scored Sun Dragons faceup in front of you.*

### MOON DRAGONS

These Fancy Dragons are only scored at the **end of the game**. When the game ends, reveal all your Moon Dragons and gain rewards from each of them whose goal you have fulfilled.

*If an ability lets you score a Moon Dragon during the game, you can’t score it again at the end of the game.*

## Abilities

The following sections provide clarifications on Artisan Dragons, Shops, and Fancy Dragons.

### RESOLVING ABILITIES

If you choose to use an ability, you must resolve as much of it as you’re able to (unless part of the ability says “you may”).

### PLACING DRAGONS

Whenever you use an ability to **place** an Artisan Dragon at a Shop, you must follow all rules for placing a Dragon (unless otherwise noted in the ability text). This means the Dragon you place must **match** the icon on the selected slot, and after placing it you gain the printed **reward** (just as if you’d placed it during step 2 of Gathering).

over at the end of your turn (not when it is first drawn).

### Rich

each other.

the game, not during end-game scoring.

### Gameplay

Take your turns one after another. Follow the same rules as a multiplayer game, with the following exceptions.

#### END OF TURN

Instead of following the standard end of turn steps, do the following:

1. **REFRESH PARK:** Reveal new faceup Artisan Dragons until there are **5** in the Park.
2. **PLACE A DRAGON:** Reveal the top Artisan Dragon from the deck. Going clockwise from the Park, find the **first empty Shop** slot that matches the Dragon’s **icon** (or is wild), and place the Dragon in that slot. If there isn’t a matching slot, return the Dragon to the bottom of the deck and draw a new one (and repeat until you can place one or run out of Dragons). If you **fill** a Shop during this step, draw a new Shop and place it in town as you normally would.
3. **MOVE A NON-PLAYER:** If the icon of the placed Dragon matches a **player token** other than yours, move that token to the Shop where the Dragon was placed. (If you are currently there, you do not receive a Good.) If the Dragon’s icon matches **your** color, don’t move any tokens.
4. **CAST AN ENCHANTMENT:** If any of the Enchantments in the faceup row has an **icon** in the top left corner that matches the icon on the **Dragon** just placed, choose one of those Enchantments and add it to a matching Shop (same icon or wild). If it could be added to more than one Shop, you choose which one.
5. **REFRESH ENCHANTMENTS:** Reveal new faceup Enchantments until there are **5** in the row.
6. **EXPAND TOWN:** Reveal all facedown Shops.

#### GIVING GOODS

When you **visit a Shop** with one or more non-player tokens, you must give **1 Good** of your choice (or 1 Coin) to each of them, as if they were players.

Whenever you would **give a Good** to another player (e.g. when visiting an occupied Shop or giving a gift), return the tokens you give directly to the appropriate piles.

#### MAX 12 SHOPS

There can be a **maximum of 12 Shops** in Town. Once there are 12 Shops in town, do **not** draw any more when existing Shops are filled (by either you or a non-player).

### Game End

If you draw or reveal the last Artisan Dragon or Enchantment at any time during your turn, finish the current turn, then play **1 more full turn** before proceeding to end-game scoring. At the end of your final turn, do not place a non-player Artisan Dragon or cast a non-player Enchantment.

#### END-GAME SCORING

Count up your final **Reputation score** as you would in a multiplayer game. Check your score against the table below and see what **award** you earned:

| Reputation | Award               |
|-----------:|---------------------|
|       0-74 | **Shopkeeper**      |
|      75-89 | **Flamekeeper**     |
|        90+ | **Master of Flame** |

### Unlocking Achievements

Solo Mode includes a number of **Achievements** that can be completed to add **new content** to your future solo games.

In order to **unlock** Achievement content, you must have a Reputation score of **75 reputation** or more at the end of the game:

* A **Flamekeeper** (75-89 reputation) is eligible to unlock **1** Achievement.
* A **Master of Flame** (90+ reputation ) is eligible to unlock up to **2** Achievements.

You may only unlock an Achievement if you meet its **requirement** at the end of the game. If you complete more Achievements than you are eligible for based on your score, you must **choose** which of them you unlock.

Each Achievement you unlock may **add** or **replace** Shops in the Shop deck you start with each game, or **add** new Fancy Dragons to the Fancy deck. When setting up a solo game, check which Achievements you’ve completed and **modify** the starting decks accordingly.
