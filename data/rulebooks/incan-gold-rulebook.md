## IDEA OF THE GAME

You and your fellow adventurers explore the ruins of an ancient Incan temple, looking for turquoise, obsidian and gold. At every turn, you must decide whether to play it safe by returning to camp with the treasure you’ve gathered so far, or to be a truly intrepid adventurer and keep on exploring. Going farther into the ruins means risking your treasure should you fall victim to the many hazards... giant spiders, wandering mummies, fire spouts and venomous snakes. But priceless Incan artifacts are rumored to exist here... and you can be the one to discover them if you conquer your fears and forge ahead!

What is your threshold for danger? How much treasure is enough for you? Find out by exploring Incan Gold!

## COMPONENTS

* **5 Temple cards to make the game board**
* **16 Player cards** *(8 Torch cards and 8 Camp cards)*
* **8 Tent cards**
* **30 Quest cards:** *15 Treasure cards and 15 Hazard cards (3 each of 5 Hazards)*
* **5 Artifact cards**
* **110 Treasures (Gems):** *60 turquoise (value of 1); 30 obsidian (value of 5); and 20 gold (value of 10)*

## PREPARATIONS

Each player takes a set of two Player cards (a Torch card and a Camp card) and a Tent. The Tent is folded out and placed in front of the player.

The Temple (consisting of five cards) is created in the center of the table as shown. The five Artifact cards are shuffled and placed face-down, one under each of the Temple cards. The Treasures are placed near the Temple. The Start player is the person who last held a real piece of gold (or not!)

## PLAYING THE GAME

The game is played in five rounds. The player with the most wealth (in Treasure value) after the fifth round wins.

## A GAME ROUND

As the Start player, you mark the beginning of the round by turning over the corresponding Temple card, starting with the card marked “1”. You show the Artifact rumored to be in this part of Temple to all players, and shuffle it into the Quest cards, making the Quest deck for this round. If an Artifact is not discovered in its disclosure round, it stays in the deck and it may be found later in the game!

A game round consists of a variable number of turns. Each turn plays as follows:

### 1) Players’ Choices.

Players still in the Temple decide if they are going to leave or not.

* Each player secretly chooses his Torch card if he is going farther into the Temple, or his Camp card if he is leaving the Temple to return to camp.
* The Start player says “GO” and everyone reveals the chosen card at the same time and places it on the table face-up.

***Note:** When the first Quest card is turned over, there’s no reason to leave, so you may skip this step and assume all players enter the Temple.*

### 2) Players Who Continue Into the Temple.

The Start player turns the top card from the Quest deck face-up and places it next to the last card drawn, making a pathway of cards. (On the first turn, place the card next to the Temple.) It may be helpful to lay Hazard cards at right angles to Treasure cards to make them easier to identify.

* If the card shows a Treasure (numbered card, blue border), the players have found some treasure. The Treasure value on the card is divided among these players, rounded down. For example, if there are four players still in the Temple, and the Treasure value is 11, each player receives 2 Treasures (2 turquoise stones). These Treasures are placed beside the players’ Tents, not inside. The 3 Treasures left over cannot be divided equally, so they are left on the Quest card.

* Artifacts. If the card shows an Artifact (gold border), the Artifact stays on the path. It’s worth extra points at the end of the game, but only to a person clever enough to get it safely back to camp!

* If the card shows a red bordered Hazard, one of two situations will happen:

* If no other Hazard of the same type has been previously revealed, nothing happens…but the players have had a glimpse of danger and doom! Note: If this is the first Quest card turned, since no one has reason to leave, you may immediately flip the next card from the Quest deck face up.

* If this is the second Hazard card of the same type, the players have been scared away from the Temple and the round is over. All players still in the Temple give back all the treasures they took during the round (the Treasures that were placed beside their Tents). This second Hazard card will be removed from the game.
* If the round is not over, the players who stayed in the Temple now take their 2 Player cards back in hand and return to making the [Players’ Choices](#1-players-choices).

The Start player remains the same until all players leave or are driven from the Temple.

### 3) Players Who Leave. If one or more players choose to leave the Temple:

* They equally divide all the treasures that have been left on any Quest cards in the path for this round. If the number of treasures cannot be divided equally, the extra treasures are left on any Quest card (which Quest card does not matter).
* They return to camp and place all the Treasures they received during this round inside their Tent. These Treasures are safe, and may not be lost.
* Artifacts. If more than one player leaves, no one gets Artifacts! If only one player leaves the Temple at this time, that player may pick up all Artifacts that are on the path. Artifacts are left beside the player’s Tent where they are safe. The first three Artifacts to leave the Temple are worth 5 points each. As a reminder of this, place an obsidian stone on those Artifact cards. Any further Artifacts that leave the Temple are worth 10 points and should be noted with a gold stone.
* Players that left the Temple leave their Camp card face-up, and take no part in play for the rest of this round.

***Note:** All players are allowed to see their opponents’ Tents, but not to touch or count what is inside.*

### 4) End of a Round

A round can end in two ways: when all players have left the Temple, or when the second Hazard card of the same type is drawn, scaring everyone away.

If the round ends because a second Hazard card is drawn, this second Hazard card is removed from the game and placed beneath the Temple card representing that round before shuffling the deck for the next round.

If there were any Artifacts on the path when the round ends, these Treasures are lost forever and removed from the game. Bad luck for the expedition!

When a round is over, the Start player passes all the Quest cards to the person to the left, and that player becomes the new Start player. A new round is begun using the same rules as above.

## END OF THE GAME

The game is played in five rounds. After the final round, the Tents are opened and players count their treasures.

### Treasures are valued as follows:

Turquoise – 1 | Obsidian – 5 | Gold – 10 | Artifacts – 5 and 10

The player with the most wealth (in Treasure value) wins. If scores are tied, the player with the most Artifacts wins. If still tied… well, play again!

## NOTES

Artifacts are new to this edition of the game. To play the original version of this game—which was called Diamant—simply remove the Artifacts from the game. Everything else stays the same.
