# Dixit Rulebook

## Contents

* One scoreboard
* 84 cards
* 36 voting tokens in 6 different colors, numbered 1 to 6
* 6 game pieces in 6 different colors

## Game Setup

Each player chooses a game piece and places it on the starting space of the scoreboard. The full deck of cards is shuffled and 6 are dealt to each player. The remaining cards form the draw pile.

* With 4 players, each player takes 4 voting tokens (numbered 1 to 4).
* With 5 players, each player takes 5 voting tokens (numbered 1 to 5).
* With 6 players, each player takes 6 voting tokens (numbered 1 to 6).

*Important: the cards dealt should not be seen by the other players.*

## Turns of the Game

### 1 - The Role of the Active Player

One of the players is the active player for the current game turn. That player examines the 6 cards in their hand. Based on one card, he/she thinks up a clue and says it out loud (without revealing the card to the other players).

The clue can take many different forms: it can be made up of one or more words, or even a sound or group of sounds. It can be invented on the spot or it can take the form of already existing works (a part of a poem or song, a movie title, a proverb, etc.).

*Choosing the first active player: the first player to create a clue for a card in their hand announces to the other players tha the/she will be the first active player of the game.*

### 2 - The Role of the Other Players

The other players choose from among their 6 cards the one which seems to best illustrate the clue given by the active player. The selected cards are handed to the active player, without being shown to the other players.

### 3 - Revealing the Cards

The active player shuffles the cards handed in together with his/her own. The cards are randomly revealed on the numbered spaces of the scoreboard.

### 4 - Voting and Attempting to Identify the Active Player's Card

The goal of the players is to find the active player's card from among those revealed. Each player votes in secret for the card he/she thinks is the active player's (the active player does not vote). To vote, each player places, face down in front of themselves, their voting token showing the number of the location that the player believes contains the active player's card.

*Important: under no circumstances can a player vote for their own card.*

### 5 - Revealing the Votes

Once everyone has voted, each player's voting tokens are turned face up and placed on the cards they designate. The active player then reveals which card was his/hers.

### 6 - Scoring

**If all players find the active player's card:**

* Active player: 0 points
* Other players: 2 points

**If no players find the active player's card:**

* Active player: 0 points
* Other players: 2 points (+1 bonus point per vote for his/her card)

**If at least one player, but not all players have found the active player's card:**

* Active player: 3 points
* Players who have found the card: 3 points (+1 bonus point per vote for his/her card)

*Clarification of the bonus points: each player, other than the active player, wins as many extra points as there are votes on his/her card.*

### 7 - Advancing Along the Scoreboard

Each player moves their game piece on the scoreboard as many spaces as points earned.

*Important: An overview of the scoring rules in on the scoreboard.*

### 8 - End of Turn

The cards that have been used are discarded. Each player draws a new card from the draw pile to refill their hand up to 6 cards. The new active player is the one to the left of the last active player. A new turn then starts.

## End of the Game

The game ends when one of the players has reached 30 points or when a player draws the last card. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

## Changes for 3 Players

* The players have 7 cards in their hand instead of 6.
* Each player takes 5 voting tokens numbered 1 to 5.
* Once the active player has created their clue, the other 2 players hand him/her 2 cards (instead of the usual 1) from their hand that could correspond to the clue. Thus, 5 cards are revealed.
* The voting and scoring rules do not change. At the end of the turn, all of the players refill their hand back up to 7 cards.
