## Chapter 1: US Chess Federation’s Official Rules of Chess

US Chess Section

### 1. Introduction

#### 1A. Scope.

Most problems concerning rules that may arise during a chess game are covered in this book. However, the rules of chess cannot and should not regulate all possible situations. In situations not explicitly covered, the tournament director can usually reach a fair decision by considering similar cases and applying their principles analogously. The United States Chess Federation (US Chess) presumes that its tournament directors have the competence, sound judgment, and absolute objectivity needed to arrive at fair and logical solutions to problems not specifically treated by these rules.

#### 1B. Validity.

US Chess play shall be governed by these rules of chess and by all US Chess procedures and policies. World Chess
Federation (Federation Internationale des Echecs, or FIDE) rules shall not be used unless specifically announced in
advance. For events that use FIDE rather than US Chess rules, International (FIDE) Laws of Chess.

##### 1B1. Notification.

Any variations from these published rules, including variations discussed in this rulebook, should be posted and/or
announced at the tournament prior to their use, preferably before the first round.

##### 1B2. Major variations.

A variation sufficiently major so that it might reasonably be expected to deter some players from entering should be
mentioned in any *Chess Life* announcement and all other detailed pre-tournament publicity and posted and/or
announced at the tournament.

#### 1C. Types of events.

##### 1C1. Major events.

While the basic laws of chess do not vary from event to event, some material in this book is designed principally for
major tournaments and is unlikely to be relevant otherwise. For example, unethical behavior is rare in chess; many
players reading this book will play virtually all their games as friendly encounters in the spirit of good
sportsmanship. But there are rare occasions, especially when large prizes or important titles are at stake, when a
player steps beyond the bounds of friendly competition. Rules are needed to cover these situations.

##### 1C2. Director discretion.

In areas in which the director has discretion, it is appropriate to be strictest with rules enforcement and penalties in
events that are stronger or offer larger prizes. Being harshly penalized over a trivial rules violation can be
sufficiently upsetting to deter a beginner from future chess participation.

###### 1C2a. Standard penalty.

Except where specifically noted in the rules, the standard penalty assessed by the director is to add two minutes to
the remaining time of the opponent of the player not following the rules of chess.

###### 1C2b. Non-standard penalties.

Except where specifically noted in the rules, the director may assess penalties either more or less severe than the
standard penalty ([1C2a](#1c2a-standard-penalty)). It is often more appropriate for a director to issue a warning(s) before applying 1C2a in
cases involving young or inexperienced players. A director may assess a more severe penalty in cases involving
players who repeatedly do not follow the rules of chess.

## 2. The Chessboard

### 2A. Explanation.

Two opponents moving pieces on a square board called a chessboard play the game.

### 2B. Description.

The chessboard is composed of sixty-four squares of identical size, eight squares by eight squares, alternately light and dark. The light squares are referred to as white squares and the dark squares black squares, even though other colors are frequently used. (For instance, in tournament play black squares are often green.)

### 2C. Placement.

The chessboard is placed between the players in such a way that the nearer corner to the right of each player is white. For information regarding chessboard placement for blind players see 35F1, Special chessboard.

### 2D. Files.

The eight vertical rows of squares are called files.

### 2E. Ranks.

The eight horizontal rows of squares are called ranks.

### 2F. Diagonals.

The lines of squares of the same color, touching at their corners only and running in a straight line from one edge of the board to another, are called diagonals; those running from one corner of the board to another are called long diagonals.

## 3. The Pieces

### 3A. Each player’s pieces.

At the beginning of the game, one player (White) has sixteen light-colored pieces (the white pieces); the other (Black) has sixteen dark-colored pieces (the black pieces).

### 3B. Description of the pieces.

These pieces are as follows:

* a white king
* a white queen
* two white rooks
* two white bishops
* two white knights
* eight white pawns
* a black king
* a black queen
* two black rooks
* two black bishops
* two black knights
* eight black pawns

### 3C. Initial position.

The initial position of the pieces on the chessboard is as follows:

<pre>
8    R K B Q K B K R
7    P P P P P P P P
6
5
4
3
2    P P P P P P P P
1    R K B Q K B K R

    A B C D E F G H
</pre>

### 3D. Meaning of *piece*.

The word *piece* has acquired various meanings in chess jargon. When used in a rules context, a *piece* is anything on the chessboard - a king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, or pawn. This book will not subsequently use the alternate connotations of *piece*, which follow for informational purposes only.

A second meaning of *piece* excludes pawns. For instance, a chess player referring to *passive pieces* or *an attack by pieces* or *forking my pieces* is referring to pieces other than pawns.

A third and even more limited meaning: If a player is said to win, lose, or sacrifice a piece, the meaning is only bishop or knight. If a queen, rook, or pawn is won, lost, or sacrificed, it is referred to by name - *winning the queen*, *winning a pawn*, etc. A bishop or knight is also known as a *minor piece*, a queen or rook as a *major piece*.

### 3E. Other expressions involving pieces.

These are presented for informational purposes only.

#### 3E1. Castling long.

Castling on the queenside (using the rook on a1, to the left of the white king, or the rook on a8, to the right of the black king). See also 8A2, Castling.

#### 3E2. Castling short.

Castling on the kingside (using the rook on h1, to the right of the white king or the rook on h8, to the left of the black king). See also 8A2, Castling.

#### 3E3. Discovered check, double check.

See Rule 12, Check.

#### 3E4. Exchange.

a. The Exchange or an Exchange refers to the difference between one player’s rook and the other’s bishop or knight. A player giving up a rook for a bishop or knight is said to lose the Exchange and that player’s opponent to win the Exchange.

b. The exchange of queens indicates the capture of each player’s queen by the other player. The same language may be used regarding rooks, bishops, knights, or pawns.

#### 3E5. Fork.

When there is a simultaneous attack on two or more pieces by one piece.

#### 3E6. Interpose.

To place a piece between one’s king and an opponent’s checking piece. See also 12A, Definition.

#### 3E7. Material.

Pieces other than the king.

#### 3E8. Pin.

A piece is said to be pinned if either it cannot legally move because such a move would expose its king to check, or moving it would be unwise because this would allow the opponent to advantageously capture a shielded piece.

#### 3E9. Sacrifice.

To deliberately allow the capture of a piece or pieces, receiving in immediate return no pieces, or a piece or pieces usually considered to have less value. The ultimate objective of a sacrifice is often to expose the opponent’s king to attack, or to recover the sacrificed material and more.

#### 3E10. Zugzwang.

A situation in which moving any piece is disadvantageous. The player in zugzwang would be better off declining to move (passing), but this is not permitted.

## 4. Objective and Scoring

### 4A. Checkmate.

The objective of each of the two players in a game of chess is to win the game by checkmating the opponent’s king. A player’s king is checkmated when the square it occupies is attacked by one or more of the opponent’s pieces and the player has no move that escapes such attack. See also Rule 12, Check; 12C, Responding to check; and 13A, Checkmate.

### 4B. Other decisive outcomes.

A common way for a player to win the game is the resignation of the opponent, conceding inevitable checkmate. A player may also win in other ways, such as the opponent’s exceeding of the time limit. See also 13, The Decisive Game.

## 4C. Draws.

An indecisive result or draw may be agreed upon, usually indicating that neither player expects to be able to checkmate the other. See also 14, The Drawn Game.

### 4D. Scoring.

For a won game, the winner gets one (1) point and the loser zero (0); for a draw, each player gets a half point (0.5 or ½). See also 22, Unplayed Games.

## 5. The Chess Clock

### 5A. Time controls and time limits.

Each player must make a certain number of moves, all moves, or all remaining moves in an allotted period of time, these factors being specified in advance. In a non-sudden death time control, if both players complete the required moves in the allotted time, a new period begins. Each such time period is called a time control or control.

Time controls appear in tournament publicity as number of moves (#), slash (/), time in minutes (mm): # / mm. For instance, if each player must make 40 moves in 1½ hours, this is abbreviated 40/90.

### 5B. Sudden death time controls.

For example, 40/120 SD/60 indicates 40 moves in two hours (120 minutes) followed by the rest of the game in one hour (60 minutes).

#### 5B1. Delay and increment.

##### 5B1a. Delay time controls.

If the time control indicates a delay (pause) time, the abbreviation d/ is used; the delay time is given in seconds.

##### 5B1b. Increment time controls.

If the time control indicates an incremental (added) time, the abbreviation inc/ (or +) is used, the added time is given in seconds of added time.

##### 5B1c. If no delay or increment is to be used then d/0 indicates no delay or increment time.

##### 5B2. Advanced publicity required time control information.

In all advance publicity which specifies the time control, the organizer is to indicate the full time control, including the delay or increment, as minutes (mm) and seconds (ss), e.g. G/90 inc/30 (or +30); G/30 d/5; G/10 d/3; G/5 d/0. The time control must be specified in Tournament Life Announcements and should be specified in other publicity such as flyer mailings, email and on web sites. It is acceptable for abbreviated publicity to refer the reader to more complete tournament details posted elsewhere.

### 5C. Ratable time controls.

There are three rating systems: Regular (slow), Quick (fast) and Blitz. For the purposes of rating G/minutes and inc/seconds (or d/seconds), add minutes (mm) and seconds (ss) for total playing time for each player. That is, total time equals minutes plus (seconds times 60) or mm+ss; e.g.: G/60 d/5 = 60+5 = 65 minutes total playing time for each player. Multiple time controls add all mm for each control: mm = mm(1) + mm(2) + . . . .

**Regular only:** Total playing time for each player is greater than 65 minutes (mm+ss > 65).

**Dual (both regular and quick):** Total playing time for each player is from 30 to 65 minutes (30 < mm+ss <65).

**Quick only:** Total playing time for each player is more than 10 and less than 30 minutes (10 < mm+ss < 30) For Regular, Dual and Quick the primary time (mm in minutes) must be at least 5 minutes.

**Blitz:** Total playing time for each player is from 5 to 10 minutes inclusive and the primary time control must be at least 3 minutes. 5 < mm+ss < 10 All rounds must use the same time control.

**TD TIP:** *Examples of standard time controls:*

|||
|-|-|
| 40/90 SD/30 inc/30 | Regular |
| 40/120 SD/60 d/5 | Regular |
| 40/115 SD/60 d/5 | Regular |
| G/120 inc/30 | Regular |
| G/120 d/5 | Regular |
| G/115 d/5 | Regular |
| G/90 inc/30 | Regular |
| G/90 d/5 | Regular |
| G/60 inc/30 | Regular |
| G/60 d/5 | Dual |
| 30/30 SD/30 d/5 | Dual |
| G/30 d/5 | Dual |
| G/25 d/5 | Dual |
| G/25 d/3 | Quick |
| G/15 d/3 | Quick |
| G/10 d/3 | Quick |
| G/10 d/0 | Blitz |
| G/5 d/0 | Blitz |
| G/3 inc/2 | Blitz |

*When used, standard increment is 30 seconds (Regular).*
*Standard delay is 5 seconds (regular or dual); and 3 seconds (quick).*
*Standard blitz uses no delay or increment (see chapter 11).*

*Although these are not all of the possible time controls, organizers are encouraged to select one of the above (or very similar) so that all participants are clear as what to expect and under which system the event will be rated.*

***TD TIP:** Here is how the changes referred to in 5C will be implemented and administered:*

***Quick Chess:** A Quick Chess event is for a person who wishes to play many games in one day and not have the results affect his regular rating. The time controls in a Quick Chess tournament are designed to be a single time control of more than 10 to less than 30 total playing minutes per player, one second delay or increment counting as 1 minute playing time. 10 < mm + ss < 30. Sudden-death rules are used in Quick Chess events, except scorekeeping is not required.*

**Dual Rating:* All events with total playing time for each player of 30 to 65 minutes inclusive (30 < mm+ss < 65) will be dual rated, that is, rated under both the Quick and Regular rating systems.*

**Blitz:** Any event that the total playing time 5 minutes or greater and is 10 minutes or less (5 ≤ mm+ss < 10) will be **Blitz rated.** (Blitz rules apply, see Chapter 11.) For clarity, it is advisable to state Blitz in the title or in the time control of the event.

**Note 1:** Game/60 d/5 is Dual Rated. If you wish for the games not to be Quick Rated, make the total basic time control at least Game in 61 minutes or longer and use a 5 second delay (61 + 5 = 66). Game/25 d/5 is also Dual Rated (25 + 5 = 30). If you do not want these games to be Regular Rated, make the time control Game/26 d/3 (26 + 3 = 29) or quicker.

**Note 2:** The TD must indicate what the time control is for all sections of all events, including the delay or increment used. If submitting by disk or paper, the time control is to be indicated. If different sections have different time controls, indicate the time control for each section. If submitting the report online, the TD is to enter the time control for all sections. The time control used indicates whether the event is regular, dual, quick or blitz.

**Note 3:** If a section has different schedules that merge, the slowest control is all that is needed, provided all games meet the criteria for the slowest time control. This applies when early rounds might fall in the dual rated group (which is regular rated, and the slower time control is regular only. All rounds will then be regular rated only.

**Example:** 3-day schedule is 40/120 SD/60. The 2 day schedule plays rounds 1 and 2 at game/45 and then merges with the 3-day schedule for round 3. All that needs to be reported is the 40/120 SD/60 (120 + 60) as US Chess cannot separate the schedules at this point. If any games in a section use a time control that is quick-ratable only (i.e. total time greater than 10 minutes but less than 30 minutes), then all games in that section must use time controls that are quick-ratable only. If any games in a section use a time control that is blitz ratable (i.e. total time between 5 and 10 minutes), then all games in that section must use time controls that are blitz ratable.

#### 5C1. Both players must have the same time control.

For a game to be ratable, the same time control must apply to both players. “Time odds” games (games in which the time control assigns the two players different base times) are not ratable.

***TD TIP:** The director may apply penalties against a player’s time before the game begins, causing the players to start the game with different times on the clock. This does not affect the ratability of the game.*

### 5D. Accumulation of time.

The time unused by a player during one control accumulates and is added to the player’s available time for the next control.

### 5E. Recommended increment or delay.

For a mixed or repeating time control, or for a base time of 30 minutes or more, an increment or delay in the range of 5 to 30 seconds is recommended. For a base time of more than 10 minutes and less than 30 minutes, an increment or delay of 3 seconds is recommended. For a base time of 10 minutes or less, an increment or delay of 2 seconds is recommended.

#### 5E1. Increment or delay with mixed time controls.

If a mixed time control includes increment or delay, the increment or delay should apply starting with the first move of the game, and the increment or delay time should be the same for all time control segments in the game.

#### 5E2. Organizer fails to specify increment or delay.

If the organizer fails to specify an increment or delay time in the time control (which may be zero to indicate no increment or delay), the minimum recommended delay specified in rule [5E](#5e-recommended-increment-or-delay) shall apply.

### 5F. Standard timer.

#### 5F1. Standard timer for increment time controls.

An increment capable clock is the standard timer for use with an increment time control.

##### 5F1a. Increment capable clock not available.

If an increment capable clock is not available, one of the following clocks, listed in order of preference from most to least preferred, may be used:

1. A delay capable clock whose delay can be set for the increment time.
2. A delay capable clock whose delay cannot be set for the increment time.
3. A digital clock that is not delay capable.
4. An analog clock.

##### 5F1b. Setting a non-increment capable clock for use with an increment time control.

In all cases, each player starts with the clock set for the base time. If the clock is delay capable and the delay can be set the same as the increment time, the clock should be so configured. Otherwise, if the clock is delay capable, set the delay time to the maximum possible value that does not exceed the increment time. If the clock is not delay capable, the clock is set to the base time.

###### 5F1b1. Variation.

The organizer may specify a different time control to be used with clocks that are capable of neither increment nor delay. This must be specified in all pre-tournament publicity that specifies the time control.

#### 5F2. Standard timer for delay time controls.

A delay capable clock is the standard timer for use with a delay time control.

##### 5F2a. Delay capable clock not available.

If a delay capable (or Bronstein capable) clock is not available, a digital clock that is not delay capable may be used. If a digital clock is not available, an analog clock may be used. In all cases, the clock is set so that each player starts with the base time.

###### 5F2a1. Variation.

The organizer may specify a different time control to be used with clocks that are not delay capable. This must be specified in all pre-tournament publicity that specifies the time control.

#### 5F3. Standard timer for time controls with neither delay nor increment.

The standard timer for a time control with neither delay nor increment is a digital clock. If a digital clock is not available, an analog clock may be used.

#### 5F4. Digital clock preferred over analog clock.

In all cases, a digital clock is preferred over an analog clock.

***TD TIP:** A digital clock operates silently. It can be set so that both players have exactly the same amount of time. Digital clocks time the game more precisely and are not subject to having the two sides of the clock run at different rates*.

#### 5F5. Replacement of non-standard timer in increment and delay time controls.

If either player arrives late for the start of the game, and a clock without delay or increment has already been started the player has the right to furnish and substitute a properly set delay or increment capable clock prior to the determination of Black’s first move. The player substituting the delay or increment capable clock must also transfer the elapsed times shown on the original clock to the replacement clock without any additional adjustments (except to correct any errors in the display of the elapsed time).

#### 5F6. Same clock used for the entire game.

Except as provided in rules [5F5](#5f5-replacement-of-non-standard-timer-in-increment-and-delay-time-controls) and Variation [14H2a](#14h2a-the-claim-is-unclear-and-a-delay-clock-is-available-for-the-game), once a game starts, the same clock must be used throughout the entire game. If a defective clock must be replaced as described in rule [16O](#16o-defective-clocks), the replacement clock shall be set in the same manner as the clock being replaced. See also [5F5](#5f5-replacement-of-non-standard-timer-in-increment-and-delay-time-controls), Replacement of non-standard timer in increment and delay time controls; Variation [14H2a, The claim is unclear and a delay clock is available for the game](#14h2a-the-claim-is-unclear-and-a-delay-clock-is-available-for-the-game); and [16O, Defective clocks](#16o-defective-clocks).

#### 5F7. Players responsible for knowing how to set the clock.

Players, not tournament directors, are responsible for knowing how to properly set their digital clocks. In any particular game, if the player providing the clock can not properly set the clock, the opponent may choose which legal clock is to be used. **See also** [16B, How to set clocks](#16b-how-to-set-clocks).

### 5G. The flag.

Monitoring of each player’s time is effected by means of a clock equipped with a flag or other special device used to
signal the end of a time control; the flag falls to indicate the player’s time has been used up. Some digital clocks
have a beep, a light, or a display of all zeros to indicate that the player’s time has been exhausted. References in this
book to a flag falling or being down also apply to such flag substitutes. See also 16E, When flag is considered down;
16F, Evidence provided by flag; 16G, premature flag fall; 16H, Apparent flag fall can cause forfeit; 35F5, Special
clock; and 42B, Signaling devices.

### 5H. Pressing the clock.

After moving, a player presses the button on his or her side of the clock, which stops that side from running and
starts the opponent’s side. This book refers to such action as pressing the clock. See also 6A, The first move; 16C,
Removing a player’s hand from the clock; 16C1, Using the clock; 16I, Starting the clock; and 16N, Beginning the
round.

### 5I. Stopping the clock.

A player who wishes to make a claim of any sort or see a director for any legitimate reason may stop both sides of
the clock before claiming and/or finding a director. This book refers to such action as stopping the clock or stopping
both clocks. If the opponent’s clock is accidentally started when a player tries to stop both clocks, the director will
determine whether the claim is still in order. See also 13C6, Claimant’s clock; 16Q, Interruption of game; 21F,
Player requests for rulings; and 21F1, Timing of requests.
TD TIP: Players should be made aware of the fact that they should generally stop the clock on their time, not their
opponent’s.

### 5J. Further details.

## 6. The Right to Move

### 6A. The first move.

White makes the first move. The players then alternate moves until the game is over. See also 5H, Pressing the
clock; 13D, Late arrival for game; 16, Use of the Chess Clock. ; 16I, Starting the clock; 16J, Black not present; 16M,
Equipment needed to start clock; and 16N, Beginning the round.

### 6B. A player on move.

A player is said to be on move or to have the move when the opponent’s move has been completed. See also 9,
Determination and Completion of the move.

## 7. Definition of the Move

### 7A. Basic definition.

With the exception of castling (8A2) and promotion of a pawn (8F6), a move is the transfer of a piece from one
square to another square that is either vacant or occupied by an opponent’s piece. See also 9, Determination and
Completion of the move.

### 7B. Crossing an occupied square.

With the exception of the king and rook in castling, no piece except the knight may cross a square occupied by
another piece. When castling the king and rook may also not cross an occupied square.

### 7C. Capturing.

A piece played to a square occupied by an opponent’s piece captures the latter as part of the move. The player
making the capture removes the captured piece immediately from the chessboard. See also 8F5, Capturing en
passant and 9B, Capturing.

## 8. The Moves of the Pieces

### 8A. The king.

#### 8A1. The king’s move.

Except when castling, the king moves to any adjoining square 
that is not attacked by one or more of the opponent’s
pieces.

#### 8A2. Castling.

Castling is a move of the king and either rook, counting as a single move and executed as follows: the king is
transferred from its original square two squares toward either rook on the same rank; then, that rook is transferred
over the king to the square adjacent to the king on the same rank. See also 8C1, Castling; 9C, Castling; 10I1, King
touched first, or king and rook simultaneously; and 10I2, Rook touched first.

#### 8A3. Castling permanently illegal.

Castling is illegal for the remainder of the game for a player:
a. If that player’s king has already moved, or
b. With a rook of that player that has already moved.

#### 8A4. Castling temporarily illegal.

Castling is not presently possible if:
a. An opponent’s piece attacks the king’s original square (12A, 12B), any square which the king must cross
over (12E), or the square the king is to occupy, or
b. There is any piece between the king and the rook with which it “is to castle.”
TD TIP: In other words: (1) the squares between the king and rook have to be empty; (2) the king cannot be in
check, and (3) the king cannot move through or into check.

### 8B. The queen.

The queen moves to any square (except as limited by 7B) on the file, rank, or diagonal(s) on which it stands.

### 8C. The rook.

The rook moves to any square (except as limited by 7B) on the file or rank on which it stands.
8C1. Castling.
Several restrictions on the king in castling (8A2, 8A3, 8A4) do not apply to the rook:
a. A player may castle with a rook whose original square is under attack.
b. A player may castle with a rook that crosses over a square under attack by an opponent’s piece. The only
examples of this are the b1 or b8 squares when castling Queenside.
c. There is no prohibition against the rook occupying a square attacked by an opponent’s piece at the
conclusion of castling, but this is impossible, as the king would have to illegally cross an attacked square to
bring it about.
For related information on castling see 8A2, Castling; 9C, Castling.
8D. The bishop.
The bishop moves to any square (except as limited by 7B) on the diagonal(s) on which it stands.
8E. The knight.
The knight’s move is composed of two different steps. First, it makes one step of one single square along the rank or
file on which it stands. It does not land on that square, as its move is not complete (9A). Then, still moving away
from the square of departure, it moves one step of one single square on a diagonal. It does not matter if the square of
the first step is occupied.
This move is sometimes called an L move, as it is equivalent to moving the knight two squares vertically, then one
square horizontally (or two squares horizontally, then one square vertically). Note that the knight always moves to a
square different in color than that of its starting square. A knight has a maximum of eight possible moves.
8F. The pawn.
8F1. The pawn’s move.
The pawn may only move forward (towards the opponent’s side of the board).
8F2. The first move of each pawn.
On its first move, a pawn advances either one or two vacant squares along its file.
8F3. Subsequent moves of each pawn.
On its subsequent moves, a pawn advances one vacant square along its file.
8F4. Pawns move vertically but capture diagonally.
The pawn is unique among chess pieces in that it captures (7C) and attacks differently from the way it moves. When
capturing, it advances one square along either of the diagonals on which it stands; it attacks these same squares.
8F5. Capturing en passant.
A pawn, attacking a square bypassed by an opponent’s pawn, the latter having advanced two squares in one move
from its original square, may capture (7C) the opponent’s pawn as though the latter had moved only one square. 

This capture may only be made in immediate reply to such advance and is called an en passant (in passing) capture.
Note that only a pawn that has advanced a total of exactly three squares from its original square is in position to
make such a capture.
8F6. Pawn promotion.
On reaching the last rank, a pawn must immediately be exchanged, as part of the same move, for the player’s choice
of a queen, a rook, a bishop, or a knight of the same color as the pawn. This exchange of the pawn for another piece
is called promotion, and the effect of the new piece is immediate. For instance, it may give check or serve to block a
check. The promotion piece is placed on the eighth-rank promotion square it touched to which the pawn was or will
be moved. See also 9D, Pawn promotion and 10H, Piece touched off the board.
TD TIP: Note that promotion is in no way related to other pieces remaining on the chessboard; for example, a
player may have two or more queens, three or more knights, or two bishops on diagonals of the same color. The
choice of the piece is not final until it has touched the promotion square on the board (See 9D also 10H).
8F7. Promoted piece not available.
If the desired piece is not available to replace a promoted pawn, the player may stop both clocks in order to locate
that piece and place it on the board. A player who cannot quickly find such a piece may request the assistance of the
director. It is common practice, however, to play using an upside-down rook for a second queen. In the absence of
the player’s announcement to the contrary, an upside-down rook shall be considered a queen. It is improper to press
the clock to start the opponent’s time with the pawn still on the last rank. If this is done, the opponent may
immediately restart the player’s clock without moving.
As soon as the new piece is placed on the board, either player should restart the clock.
TD TIP: Clocks that have a move counter may need to be readjusted if a player improperly presses the clock with a
pawn still on the last rank and the opponent immediately restarts the player’s clock.
9. Determination and Completion of the Move
9A. Transfer to a vacant square.
In the case of the legal transfer of a piece to a vacant square, the move (7A, 7B, 7C) is determined with no
possibility of change when the player’s hand has released the piece, and completed when that player presses the
clock (5H).
9B. Capturing.
In the case of a legal capture (7C), the move is determined with no possibility of change when the player has
deliberately touched both his or her own piece and the opponent’s piece (10C) and completed when that player
presses the clock (5H). See also 9G, Determined moves and completed moves.
9C. Castling.
In the case of legal castling (8A2, 8C1, 10I1, 10I2), the move is determined with no possibility of change when the
player’s hand has released the king, which has moved two squares toward a rook, and completed when that player,
having legally transferred the rook to its new square, presses the clock (5H).
9D. Pawn promotion.
In the case of the legal promotion of a pawn, the move is determined with no possibility of change when the pawn
has been removed from the chessboard and the player’s hand has released the new appropriate piece on the
promotion square, and completed when that player presses the clock (5H). If the player has released the pawn on the
last rank, the move is not yet determined, but the player no longer has the right to play the pawn to another square.
The choice of piece is finalized when the piece has touched the square of promotion, regardless of whether the pawn
has been physically touched or placed on the promotion square. Once a piece has touched the promotion square a
pawn must be promoted to that piece on that square, provided that the move is legal.
See also 8F6, Pawn promotion and 10H, Piece touched off the board.

TD TIP: Some players thinking they are being “clever” have tried to place one of their opponent’s pieces on the
promotion square or inappropriately give themselves a second king; however, this is not legal, only “clever.”
9E. Checkmate or stalemate.
In the case of a legal move which produces checkmate (13A, 4A) or stalemate (14A), the move is determined with
no possibility of change upon release as described in 9A, 9B, 9C, or 9D, whichever applies. The move is completed
simultaneously with its determination.
TD TIP: If the final legal move produces checkmate or stalemate, pressing or stopping the clock, while
recommended, is not required because checkmate or stalemate immediately ends the game. See also rules 13A1, The
clock after checkmate and 14A1, The clock after stalemate.
9F. Last move of the time control.
When determining whether the prescribed number of legal moves has been made in the allotted time, the last move
is considered complete only after the player presses the clock (5H). The player’s flag may be up after releasing the
piece, it may be up while hitting the clock, but if the flag is down after the move and the opponent has not yet
handled the clock, the player has failed to make the time control. For more information regarding analog and
digital flag falls see 5G, The flag.
Except for 9E, there should never be a dispute about whether the final move of a time control or a flag fall occurred
first, because a player’s task is to press the clock in time to prevent the flag fall. If the flag is down, the player has
not accomplished this task, and the director must rule that the move was not completed in time. If the final move of
the time control produces checkmate or stalemate, then see 9E.
9G. Determined moves and completed moves.
As described in 9A through 9D above, there is a period between the release of a piece and the press of the clock
during which the move is determined but not completed. The significance of this period is as follows (for
information on determined moves and the visually impaired or handicapped player see 35F4, Determination of a
move):
9G1. Player still on move for claims.
Claims of triple occurrence of position (14C), the 50-move rule (14F), or insufficient losing chances in sudden death
(Variation 14H) remain in order during the period between determination and completion of the move. As soon as
the player completes the move, it is the opponent’s move, and the right to make such claims belongs exclusively to
the opponent.
9G2. Determination irrelevant to time control.
In the case of 9F, Last move of the time control, whether or not the player has determined the move is of no
significance in deciding whether the player has made the prescribed number of moves in the allotted time. The
player’s flag must remain up (5G) after the final legal move has been completed, not just determined.
9G3. Draw offers.
Except for Variation 14H2, Resolution of Variation 14H claim, the interval between determination and completion
of the move is the proper time to offer a draw (14B1). See also 14, The Drawn Game.
TD TIP: The first step in resolving a properly made draw claim, including an insufficient losing chances (Variation
14H) claim in sudden death, is to notify the opponent of the claimant that a claim is the same as offering the
opponent a draw; however, the draw offer is proper even if a move has not been determined or completed. See rule
14, The Drawn Game, for more information on draw claims being considered draw offers.
9H. Stopping the clock. 

If a player determines a move and then stops the clock to see a director for any reason, rather than pressing it, the
determined move is not yet completed and the player is still on move for claims (9G1).
10. The Touched Piece
TD TIP: Without a neutral witness, Rule 10 depends on the reliability of both the claimant and the opponent. If they
disagree then the TD should strongly consider denying the claim. In most cases, by denying the claim the TD shuts
the door to all false claims. Upholding a false claim usually does more harm to more players than denying an
accurate claim.
10A. Adjustment of pieces.
A player who is on the move and first expresses the intention to adjust (e.g., by saying j’adoube or I adjust) may
adjust one or more pieces on their squares. See also 10E, Accidental touch of piece and 10F, appearance of
adjustment.
10B. Touch-move rule.
Except for 10A, a player on move who deliberately touches one or more pieces, in a manner that may reasonably be
interpreted as the beginning of a move, must move or capture the first piece touched that can be moved or captured.
See also 10E, Accidental touch of piece; 10F, appearance of adjustment; and 35F3 (the touch-move rule for blind
and disabled players).
TD TIP: The key word here is deliberately. Be especially thorough at scholastic events when investigating a
“Touch-move rule” claim without a witness. After talking to the claimant and opponent, TDs will find that
opponents often insist that they did not “deliberately” touch a piece. Often, after some further discussion, the TD
will find that some of the opponents really did physically touch the piece in such a way that it appeared as if they
intended to move it (not an accident); however, they will explain that they really intended to move another piece;
therefore, they believe that since the “touch” was not literally “deliberate” (since they intended to move another
piece), the rule was not broken. The TD will have to uphold the claim in this instance.
10C. Touching pieces of both colors.
Except for 10A, a player on the move who deliberately touches one or more pieces of each color, or who moves the
player’s piece and intentionally displaces an opponent’s piece with it, must capture the opponent’s piece with the
player’s piece, or, if this is illegal, must move or capture the first piece touched that can be moved or captured. If it
is impossible to establish which piece was touched first, the player’s piece shall be considered the touched piece.
10D. Piece touched cannot move.
If no piece touched has a legal move, and no opponent’s piece touched can be legally captured, the player is free to
make any legal move.
10E. Accidental touch of piece.
A director who believes a player touched a piece by accident should not require the player to move that piece. For
example, a player’s hand reaching across the board may inadvertently brush the top of a nearby king or queen, or a
player may hit a piece with an elbow. See also 10 A, Adjustment of pieces; 10B, Touch-move rule; and 10F,
Appearance of adjustment.
10F. Appearance of adjustment.
Sometimes it is clear that a player is adjusting, even when that player improperly fails to say j’adoube or I adjust.
For instance, a player who uses one finger to slide a piece to the center of its square is not acting in a manner usual
to the beginning of a move, and probably should not be required to move the piece. Players are warned, though, that
it is wise to announce one is adjusting in advance, as a safeguard against being forced to make an unwanted move.
See also 10 A, Adjustment of pieces; 10B, Touch-move rule; and 10E, Accidental touch of a piece.
10G. Accidental release of piece.
A player who deliberately touches a piece and then accidentally releases it on an unintended but legal square is
required to leave it on that square. 

10H. Piece touched off the board.
There is no penalty for touching a piece that is off the board. A player who advances a pawn to the last rank and then
touches a piece off the board is not obligated to promote the pawn to the piece touched until that piece touches the
promotion square. See also 8F6, Pawn promotion and 9D, Pawn promotion.
10I. Castling.
For description and further information of castling, see 8A2, 8A3, 8A4, 8C1, and 9C.
10I1. King touched first, or king and rook simultaneously.
If a player intending to castle touches the king first, or king and rook at the same time, and then realizes that castling
is illegal, the player may choose either to move the king or to castle on the other side if legal. If the king has no legal
move, the player is free to choose any move.
10I2. Rook touched first.
If a player intending to castle touches the rook first, castling is not allowed and the player must move the rook as
required by rule 10B.
10I2. (Variation I) Rook touched first.
If a player intending to castle touches the rook first, there is no penalty except if castling is illegal, the player must
move the rook if legal. This variation does not need to be announced in advanced publicity but should be announced
at the start of the tournament.
10J. When to claim touch-move.
To claim the opponent has violated 10B, Touch move rule, or 10C, Touching pieces of both colors, a player must do
so before deliberately touching a piece.
11. Illegal Positions
11A. Illegal move during last ten moves.
If, during a game, it is found that one of either player’s last ten moves was illegal and neither player is in time
pressure (11D1), the position shall be reinstated to what it was before the illegal move. The players do not recover
the time used after the illegal move. The game shall then continue by applying Rule 10, The Touched Piece, to the
move replacing the illegal move. If the position cannot be reinstated, then the illegal move shall stand. Move
counters on clocks that have them may be readjusted. See also 11H, Director corrects illegal move in non-sudden
death and 16R, No time adjustment for reinstated position.
TD TIP: When the illegal move is a king left in check, special care should be taken by the director. All moves, not
just the first move, in which a player’s king remains in check should be regarded as illegal. That way, an illegal
move will always have occurred within the last half-move; therefore, players cannot argue that the illegal move(s)
should stand. Now, go back to the first illegal move that occurred (leaving the king in check). If the moves cannot be
reconstructed, go back to a position in which the king is in check, so that the king can get out of check. In
complicated cases like this the director has a lot of discretion. No player should gain an unfair advantage for
deliberate illegal moves, or for inadvertent ones, which were deliberately not pointed out. Remember that the clock
times will not be re-adjusted; however, move counters may need to be reset to the proper move number.
11B. Illegal move prior to last ten moves.
If it is found that an illegal move was made prior to each player’s last ten moves, the illegal move shall stand and the
game shall continue.
TD TIP: When the illegal move is a king left in check see the TD TIP after rule 11A.
11C. Accidental piece displacement.

If, during a game, one or more pieces have been accidentally displaced and incorrectly replaced, then the
displacement shall be treated as an illegal move. If, during the course of a move, a player inadvertently knocks over
one or more pieces, that player must not press the clock until the position has been reestablished. The opponent may
press the clock without moving, if necessary, to force the player who knocked over the piece(s) to restore the
position on his or her own time. If possible, clocks with move counters should be readjusted.
TD TIP: If using increment time control it may not be to a player’s advantage to start the opponent’s clock if the
opponent created an illegal position or accidentally displaced pieces. In that case the players may stop or pause the
clock until the correct position is reinstated.
11D. Illegal move.
If a player completes an illegal move by pressing the clock, in addition to the usual obligation to make a legal move
with the touched piece if possible, the standard penalty specified in rule 1C2a applies (i.e. two minutes added to the
opponent’s clock). See also 11J, Deliberate illegal moves and 16D1, Illegal moves.
11D1. Illegal move in time pressure.
Time pressure is defined as a situation where either player has less than five minutes left in a time control and the
time control does not include an increment or delay of 30 seconds or more. A director should not call attention to
illegal moves in time pressure, only the players may make that claim. If, during the game, in time pressure, a
player’s claim that one of either player’s last two moves was illegal is upheld by the TD, the position shall be
reinstated to what it was before the illegal move and the procedure in rule 11A shall be followed, with no adjustment
to the time on the clocks. See also 16D1, Illegal moves; 11H, Director corrects illegal move in non-sudden death;
and 11J, Deliberate illegal moves.
TD TIP: When the illegal move is a king left in check see the TD TIP after rule 11A.
11E. Incorrect adjourned position.
If, after an adjournment, the position is incorrectly set up, then the position as it was at adjournment must be set up
again and the game continued, subject to the provisions of Rule 11A, Illegal move during last ten moves. The time
on the clocks shall not be adjusted; however, move counters on clocks that have them may be readjusted. See also
16R, No time adjustment for reinstated position and 19I, Game resumed with incorrect position.
11F. Incorrect initial position.
If, before the completion of Black’s 10th move, it is found that the initial position of the pieces was incorrect, or that
the game began with the colors reversed, then the game shall be annulled and a new game played. However, the
players shall begin the new game with their clocks still reflecting the elapsed time each player used in the annulled
game; however, move counters on clocks that have them may be readjusted. If the error is discovered after the
completion of Black’s 10th move, the game shall continue. See also 16R, No time adjustment for reinstated position.
11G. Incorrect placement of chessboard.
If, during a game, it is found that the board has been placed contrary to 2C, Placement, which requires a white
square in the nearer corner to the right of each player, then the position reached shall be transferred to a board
correctly placed and the game continued.
11H. Director corrects illegal move outside of time pressure.
Except in a time pressure situation (11D1), a director who witnesses an illegal move being made shall require the
player to replace that move with a legal one in accordance with 10B, Touch-move rule. The time on the clocks shall
not be adjusted; however, move counters on clocks that have them may be readjusted. See also 11J, Deliberate
illegal moves and 21D, Intervening in games.
Variation 11H1. Director as witness only.

In an event in which most games are not watched by directors, a director may refrain from correcting all illegal
moves he or she may notice but simply serve as a witness should one of the players point out the illegal move before
ten more moves have been made (11A).
If used, this variation must be applied consistently; i.e., a director may not require players to correct illegal moves
when witnessed in some cases but not in others. This variation does not need to be announced in advance.
11I. Spectators.
Spectators must not point out illegal moves (20M5), except to the director in a manner neither heard nor noticed by
the players. See also 16Y, Assisting players with time management prohibited and 20M, Behavior of spectators.
11J. Deliberate illegal moves.
If a player intentionally makes illegal moves, the director may impose penalties. See also 1C2, Director discretion;
11D, Illegal move; 21F, Player requests for rulings; and 21K, Use of director’s power.
12. Check
12A. Definition.
The king is in check when the square it occupies is attacked by one or more of the opponent’s pieces; such pieces are
said to be checking the king. Check is parried (a player gets out of check) by capturing a sole checking opposing
piece, interposing one of the player’s own pieces between a sole checking piece and the king (not possible if
checking piece is a knight), or moving the king. The king cannot parry check by castling (8A4).
12B. Double check.
The square occupied by the king being attacked by two opposing pieces is known as double check, and may be
parried only by moving the king. The king cannot parry double check by castling (8A4).
12C. Responding to check.
Check must be parried on the move immediately following. If a player’s king is unable to escape check, it is
checkmated and the player loses the game (13A).
12D. Check by interposing piece.
A piece blocking a check to the king of its own color, commonly referred to as interposing, can itself give check to
the enemy king.
12E. Moving into check.
A player may not move the king, including castling (8A4), to a square attacked by one or more opponent’s pieces.
No move may be made by any piece which puts the player’s own king in check. If a player does so, it is an illegal
move. See also 11, Illegal Positions.
12F. Calling check not mandatory.
Announcing check is not required, and is rare in high-level tournaments. It is the responsibility of the opponent to
notice the check, and a player who does not may suffer serious consequences. A player may announce check. See
also Rule 10, The touched piece.
13. The Decisive Game
13A. Checkmate.
The player who checkmates the opponent’s king, providing the mating move is legal, wins the game. This
immediately ends the game. See also 4A, Checkmate; 9E, Checkmate or stalemate; 12C, Responding to check; and
15H, Reporting of results.

TD TIP: This means that anything that happens after the checkmate move has been legally determined (see rule 9,
Determination and completion of the move) is irrelevant to the outcome of the game, including the player’s flag
falling (5G).
13A1. The clock after checkmate.
A player who checkmates the opponent is not obligated to then press (5H) or stop (5I) the clock, as checkmate takes
priority over a subsequent flag fall. A player delivering checkmate may choose to press the clock to minimize the
possibility of dispute. See also 9E, Checkmate or stalemate.
13A2. Flag fall before checkmate.
If a player claims a win by time forfeit (13C) before the opponent determines a move delivering checkmate, the time
forfeit claim is appropriate.
13A3. Unclear if checkmate or flag fall came first.
After considering all available evidence, including testimony by the players and any witnesses, a director who is still
unable to decide whether the claim of the flag fall occurred first shall deny the time claim and rule the checkmate
valid.
13B. Resignation.
The player whose opponent resigns wins the game. This immediately ends the game. Saying I resign or tipping over
the king are relatively clear ways to resign.
Stopping both clocks does not necessarily indicate a resignation. Since a player may be making a claim or seeing a
director, the opponent should not assume a player who stops both clocks has resigned without further evidence.
Likewise, the offer of a handshake is not necessarily a resignation. On occasion, one player believes the handshake
agrees to a draw while the other interprets it as a resignation. See also 15H, Reporting of Results; 16S, Priority of
agreed result over time-forfeit claim and 19G2, Resignation and invalid move.
13C. Time forfeit.
a. Non-Sudden Death: The player who properly claims that the opponent has not completed the prescribed
number of moves in the allotted time wins the game, provided that the claimant has mating material (14E)
and a reasonably complete scoresheet (13C7) when the flag falls (5G). Move counters, on clocks equipped
with them, may not be used as the only evidence in claiming that the prescribed number of moves were not
completed in the allotted time.
b. Sudden Death: The player who properly claims that the opponent has not completed the game in the
allotted time, and has mating material (14E), wins the game. A scoresheet is not required to win on time in
a sudden death time control (15C).
See also 15H, Reporting of results and 19G3, Loss on time and invalid move.
13C1. Only players may call flag.
Only the players in a game may call attention to the fall of a flag (See also 5G); it is considered to have fallen only
when either player points this out. A director must never initiate a time-forfeit claim.
Spectators, including players of other games, who point out the fall of a flag in any manner, may be disciplined by
the tournament director to the point of expulsion from the playing room, loss of their own games, or expulsion from
the tournament. The recipient of such assistance may also be penalized (20E). See also 16Y, Assisting players with
time management prohibited; 20E1, Solicited advice; 20E2, Unsolicited advice; 20M, Spectators; and 20M5,
Spectators cannot make claims.
TD TIP: The key word here is “may.” Directors must exercise extreme caution in penalizing unsolicited advice.
Reviewing Rule 20E, Soliciting or using advice prohibited, before making a ruling is advised. Remember in FIDE
competitions the arbiter can call the flag, and should do so.

13C2. Player may call own flag for protection in non-sudden death.
A player may call attention to the fall of his or her own flag. This initiates the time forfeiture procedure, the same as
if the opponent had made a claim. A player will likely exercise this option in order to make it clear that any moves
the opponent may subsequently fill in or correct on the scoresheet are invalid for the purpose of having an adequate
score. See also 13C3, Filling in moves with flag down.
TD TIP: This rule was designed to protect the player who is short of time, in a non-sudden death time control, from
an opponent, who has plenty of time to write down moves as they are being made, who instead “blitzes” or rushes,
move after move without filling in a scoresheet contrary to 15A, Manner of keeping score.
13C3. Filling in moves with flag down.
Once either player points out the fallen flag, neither is permitted to fill in or correct any previous moves missing
from the scoresheet. It is especially important that a player who expects to win on time not fill in missing moves.
Such additions or corrections are not considered for the purpose of determining whether the scoresheet is reasonably
complete (13C7), and may obscure a valid claim.
TD TIP: Enforcement of this rule often depends on an independent witness.
13C4. Consequence of filling in moves.
A player who improperly fills in missing moves after a fallen flag has been pointed out may not win by time forfeit
unless the director is certain that the player’s scoresheet would have been sufficient to win on time without the
improper additions. A director who is unsure on this point should give the benefit of the doubt to the opponent of the
claimant.
TD TIP: Enforcement of this rule often depends on an independent witness.
13C5. How to claim.
To claim a win by time forfeit, a player should stop both clocks (5I) and state the claim. If the opponent accepts the
claim, the game is over. If the opponent does not accept the claim, the claimant must present the claim to a director.
13C6. Claimant’s clock.
If a player who claims a time forfeit states the claim with claimant’s flag still up (5G), but then fails to stop the clock
in time to avoid also exceeding the time limit, the claim will be void, unless the flag fall was observed by a director
or independent witness. See also 5I, Stopping the clock; 13C13, Player out of time cannot claim; 16Q, Interruption
of game; 21F, Player requests for rulings; 21F1, Timing of requests, and 16T, Both players exceed time control.
TD TIP: A director who is aware that a claimant has neglected to stop the clock should instruct the claimant to do
so.
13C7. Definition of reasonably complete scoresheet.
Unless otherwise posted or announced in advance at the site, a reasonably complete scoresheet is one that has no
more than three missing or incomplete move pairs (consecutive moves, white and black or black and white). The
absence of three consecutive individual moves, e.g. white-black-white, counts as two incomplete move pairs.
The move pair is considered incomplete if either side’s move is omitted or incomplete. No move pair is ever
considered to be half complete.
Minor ambiguities in scorekeeping or errors involving no more than one symbol are of no consequence. The
common error of omitting one move by one player and subsequently putting moves in the wrong columns counts as
only one error. Moves that are indecipherable or recorded only with check marks are considered missing. See also:
15, The recording of the games.
TD TIP: An example of a minor ambiguity would be for the player of the black pieces to write Nf3 on a scoresheet
in place of Nf6 in the opening when Nf3 is clearly not even possible.
13C8. Use of opponent’s scoresheet in non-sudden death.

The director may use the scoresheet of the claimant’s opponent to determine that the requisite number of moves has
been made or that the claimant’s scoresheet is in error. The director may also use the opponent’s scoresheet to assist
in playing over the game. No player, however, may be forfeited based solely on the evidence of his or her own
scoresheet.
13C9. Player may demonstrate making time control in non-sudden death.
If the opponent of the claimant demonstrates that the required number of moves must have been made in order to
reach the position on the board, the director shall deny the claim.
TD TIP: If the opponent points out the correct number of moves have been made to reach the position on the board
due to move repetitions, but does not have an accurate score or an independent witness to verify this fact, the
director should rule in favor of the claimant.
13C10. Director not obligated to play over game in non-sudden death.
If the claimant’s scoresheet appears to be sufficiently complete and both scoresheets appear to be substantially
identical and agree on the number of moves made, the director need not play over those moves but may instead
require the player whose flag has fallen (5G) to demonstrate why the opponent’s scoresheet is not sufficient to win
on time.
13C11. Time forfeit claim denied in non-sudden death.
If a flag is down but a claimant’s scoresheet is insufficient to win on time, two minutes shall be added to the
claimant’s opponent’s remaining time and the game shall continue. No further time forfeit claims during that time
control are allowed; a claim of time forfeit shall be allowed during subsequent time controls.
TD TIP: Example: In a 40/120 20/60 game, if a time forfeit claim for the first time control is denied on move 35,
then another time forfeit claim is not available for either player (13C13) until the end of the second time control (at
flag fall after three hours by one player).
13C12. Both scoresheets inadequate in non-sudden death.
If both players agree that sufficient moves have been made or that both scoresheets are inadequate for time forfeit
claims, and it is impossible to establish the exact number of moves, no further claims on that time control are
permitted. The subsequent time control period is in effect. The players should diagram or create a record of the
position to serve as a reference point for future claims.
13C13. Player out of time cannot claim.
A player whose own flag has fallen (5G) may not win on time during that control. See also 16T, Both players
exceed time control.
13C14. Role of director during time trouble.
It is beneficial for a director to be present in an area with games in which the players are in time trouble, to observe
the players and safeguard against disturbance such as spectators or players talking or crowding too close to a game.
However, it is not recommended that directors concentrate on watching clocks except to tell when they may go back
to other duties. This would accomplish little, as only players may call flags down, and a fallen flag (5G) constitutes
evidence equal in value to the witnessing of a falling flag. See also: 13C6, Claimant’s clock.
13C15. Variations.
Any variations on these procedures, such as use of FIDE methods that require a director or deputy to be present at
each board and to claim time forfeits on behalf of the players, must be clearly announced before the start of the
tournament.
13D. Late arrival for game.
The player who arrives at the chessboard more than one hour late for the beginning of the game or arrives after the
expiration of the first or only time control period, whichever comes first, loses the game. The absence countdown
begins at the actual starting time of the round, which is not always the scheduled starting time. A director who learns
that a player is unavoidably delayed may waive the one-hour forfeit rule. See also 13F, Late arrival by both players; 

15H, Reporting of results; 16K, Both players late; 16M, Equipment needed to start clock; 22A, Games forfeited due
to nonappearance; and 28P, Unplayed games.
TD TIP: Example in a single sudden death time control: if the time control is G/30 then a player who arrives 31
minutes after the start of that game will lose. A player who arrives at any time before the flag falls may play the
game with whatever amount of time is left on the player’s clock.
Variation 13D1. Equipment must be set up.
To win under 13D, a player must set up a board, a set, and a clock, start the opponent’s clock, and run the clock until
the opponent has one hour of elapsed time or the first or only time control period has expired, whichever comes first.
If both players are late, the first to arrive must split the elapsed time from the start of the game until the arrival time
before starting the opponent’s clock (see 16K, Both players late).
TD TIP: For example, if the first player is 30 minutes late in a non-sudden death time control period of 40/120,
each player would start with 15 minutes elapsed, and the second player would not lose on time, due to nonappearance, until 45 minutes later. Another example: in a G/30 single sudden death time control, or one that is less
than one hour, the first player arrives 10 minutes late. Each player would start with 5 minutes elapsed. The second
player would not lose on time, due to non-appearance, until 25 minutes later.
13E. Late arrival for adjournment resumption.
The player who arrives at the chessboard more than one hour late for the resumption of an adjourned game or arrives
after the expiration of the existing time period, whichever comes first, loses the game. A director who learns that a
player is unavoidably delayed may waive the one-hour forfeit rule. However, if the player who sealed the move is
the late player, the game is decided otherwise if either of the following conditions exists:
13E1. Checkmate.
The absent player has won the game by virtue of the fact that the sealed move produces checkmate.
13E2. Stalemate or insufficient material.
The absent player has produced a drawn game by virtue of the fact that the sealed move has caused a stalemate
(14A), or if one of the positions in 14D, Insufficient material to continue, has arisen.
13F. Late arrival by both players.
If both players arrive at the chessboard more than one hour late in a non-sudden death time control period or after
the flags have fallen in a single sudden-death time control, whichever comes first, the director may declare the game
lost by both players. See also 13D, Late arrival for game; 15H, Reporting of results; 16K, Both players late; 22A,
Games forfeited due to nonappearance; and 28P, Unplayed games.
13G. Players must give notice if withdrawing or skipping a round.
A player who does not notify the tournament director well in advance of the inability to play in any round and then
defaults the game under 13D, Late arrival for the game, may be ejected from the tournament, and may be fined a
sum up to the amount of the entry fee, payable to the organizer. The player may be barred from any of the
organizer’s tournaments until the fine is paid. On request, the player may be retained in or readmitted to the
tournament at the director’s discretion. See also 16K, Both players late; 22A, Games forfeited due to
nonappearance; and 28P, Unplayed games.
TD TIP: It is useful to have a withdrawal signup sheet available until the pairings are made for the last round.
Directors are urged to check this list before making any pairings.
13H. Sealing of invalid move.
A player who has sealed a move that the director finds has no reasonable interpretation loses the game. However, a
director who finds there are two or more reasonable interpretations of an ambiguous sealed move may allow sealer’s
opponent to choose between the possibilities. See also 19G, Sealed move invalid and 19F, Sealed move ambiguous.
13I. Refusal to obey rules.

The director may declare a game lost by a player who refuses to comply with the rules. If both players refuse to
comply with the rules, the director may declare the game lost by both players. See also 1C2, Director discretion;
21F, Player requests for rulings; and 21K, Use of director’s power.
TD TIP: It is often useful, but not required, to employ the following steps before applying 13I or dealing with a rule
that has no specific penalty:
Step 1: The director warns the player who does not comply with the rules.
Step 2: The director adds two minutes, or more if necessary, to the time of the opponent of the player who does not
comply with the rules. Some TDs repeat this step more than once.
Step 3: The director enforces 13I after steps 1 and 2 have been unsuccessful in getting a player to comply with the
rules.
14. The Drawn Game
All draw claims are also draw offers (14B). The player by making any draw claim (for example: triple occurrence of
position (14C), insufficient material to continue (14D), insufficient material to win on time (14E), the 50-move rule
(14F), both flags down in sudden death (14G), insufficient losing chances (Variation 14H), …) is also making an
implied offer of a draw to the opponent. If the opponent accepts the implied draw offer, the game is over.
1. The opponent may immediately accept the draw offer and end the game (14B), or instead
2. The opponent may ask the director to rule on the claim. If the director upholds the draw claim, the game is
over.
3. If the director does not uphold the claim (does not declare the game a draw), the game continues. The
implied draw offer is still in effect, and the opponent may accept it or reject it (14B).
TD TIP: When a draw claim is made, the director should inform the opponent of the draw offer. The opponent need
not immediately accept the draw offer. Instead, the opponent may first wait and see what the director rules. The
director’s ruling might or might not end the game in a draw. If the claim is denied, then the director restarts the
game. In restarting the game, the director assesses penalties, if appropriate according to the rules, and starts the
clock. The draw claim becomes a 14B draw offer. The director should remind both players of this draw offer when
starting the clock.
14A. Stalemate.
The game is drawn when the king of the player to move is not in check and that player has no legal move. This type
of draw is called stalemate. Providing that the opponent’s previous move is legal, this immediately ends the game.
Note that it is incorrect to refer to all drawn games as stalemate. The draws described in 14B through 14J are not
stalemates. See also 9E, Checkmate or stalemate; and 15H, Reporting results.
TD TIP: This means that anything, including the fall of the flag, which happens after the stalemate move has been
legally determined (see 9, Determination and Completion of the Move) is irrelevant to the outcome of the game.
Also, remember a 14A stalemate draw claim is a draw offer (Rule 14, The Drawn Game).
14A1. The clock after stalemate.
Just as with a checkmate, a player who stalemates the opponent is not obligated to then press (5H) or stop (5I) the
clock, as stalemate takes priority over a subsequent flag fall. A player delivering stalemate may choose to press the
clock to minimize the possibility of dispute. See also 9E, Checkmate or stalemate.
14A2. Flag fall before stalemate.
If a player claims a win on time (13C) before the opponent releases a piece that will deliver stalemate, the time
forfeit claim is appropriate.
14A3. Unclear if stalemate or flag came first.
After considering all available evidence, including testimony by the players and any witnesses, a director who is
unable to determine whether the flag fall occurred first shall deny the time claim and uphold the stalemate.
14B. Agreement.

The game is drawn upon agreement between the two players. This immediately ends the game. See also 15H,
Reporting of results; 16S, Priority of agreed result over time-forfeit claim; 19G1, Agreed draw and invalid move and
19J, Agreed result of adjourned game.
14B1. Proper timing of draw offer.
Except for a draw claim, which is an implicit draw offer (14), a player should make a proposal of a draw only after
determining a move (9G) and before pressing the clock. The opponent may accept the proposal or may reject it
either orally or by deliberately touching a piece (10B). In the interim, the player who made the offer cannot
withdraw it. See also 9G3, Draw offers.
TD TIP: The first step in resolving a properly made draw claim is to notify the opponent of the claimant that all
draw claims are the same as offering the opponent a draw (Rule 14,The Drawn Game); however, a rule 14 draw
claim is a proper (inherent) draw offer even if a move has not been determined or completed.
14B2. Draw offer with opponent on move.
If a player offers a draw while the opponent’s clock is running, the opponent may accept or reject the offer. A player
who offers a draw in this manner may be warned or penalized for annoying the opponent (20G). See also 14, The
Drawn Game.
14B3. Draw offer before moving.
A player that proposes a draw before moving must allow the offer to stand until the opponent either accepts or
rejects it. Such a proposal, while unlikely to annoy the opponent, can be disadvantageous, as the player may
subsequently notice a strong move and regret the inability to withdraw the offer. See also 14, The Drawn Game.
The opponent of a player who offered a draw in this manner has the right to require the player who offered the draw
to move before deciding whether to accept the offer, and may respond, “Make your move first,” or words to that
effect, or remain silent. In any case, the offer may not be withdrawn.
14B4. Flag fall during pending draw offer.
A player who offers a draw may claim a win on time (13C) if the opponent oversteps the time limit while
considering the proposal unless the offer is accepted before the flag fall (5G) is claimed. See also 14, The Drawn
Game.
14B5. Repeated offers.
Repeated draw offers may be construed as annoying the opponent, and penalties are possible at the discretion of the
TD (20G). If the first offer has been declined, it is improper to offer another draw unless the opponent has since
offered a draw or the position has changed substantially.
TD TIP: It is a good idea for a director to issue a warning before applying any penalties for repeated draw offers.
14B6. Premature or prearranged draws.
It is unethical and unsporting to agree to a draw before a serious contest has begun. The same is true of all
arrangements to prearrange game results. In case of clear violations of the moral principles of the game, penalties
should be imposed at the director’s discretion. See also 20L, Manipulating results.
TD TIP: Trying to enforce this rule is difficult. Forcing two players to continue playing when they are resolute on
obtaining a result of a draw will produce a sometimes very quick game with many moves resulting in a draw
anyhow. Often last-round games may not be prearranged; however, due to prize fund distribution considerations the
result can be easily predicted. In cases involving prearranged draws it is wise to have clear and irrefutable evidence
before imposing any penalties.
14C. Triple occurrence of position.
The game is drawn upon a correct claim by the player on the move when the same position is about to appear for at
least the third time or has just appeared for at least the third time, the same player being on move each time. In both 
cases, the position is considered the same if pieces of the same kind and color occupy the same squares and if the
possible moves of all the pieces are the same, including the right to castle (8A2, 8A3, 8A4) or to capture a pawn en
passant (8F5). See also 14C8, Sudden death time pressure; 14C9, Claimant’s scoresheet; and 15H, Reporting of
results.
TD TIP: Remember a triple occurrence draw claim is a draw offer (Rule 14, The Drawn Game).
14C1. No repetition of moves or perpetual check draw.
There is no rule regarding a draw by repetition of moves. The draw is based on repetition of position. The three
positions need not be consecutive, and the intervening moves do not matter. There is also no rule regarding
perpetual check. It is irrelevant whether the claimant of 14C is delivering check or whether the thrice-repeated
position involves check.
TD TIP: “Perpetual check” and “three consecutive positions” are often-occurring special cases of 14C, Triple
occurrence of position; therefore, claimants need to make a 14C claim in order to try to secure a triple occurrence
of position draw when these special cases occur; however, if a player makes a “perpetual check” or “three
consecutive positions” claim it is considered first a draw offer (Rule 14, The Drawn Game).
14C2. How to claim.
If a move is required to complete the third occurrence of the position, the player claiming the draw under 14C
should write this move on the scoresheet but not play the move on the board, stop both clocks (5I), and state the
claim. If no move is required to complete the repetition, the player should stop both clocks without moving and state
the claim.
In both cases, if the opponent agrees, the game is drawn. If the opponent does not agree, the claimant may make the
claim to a director. If a director denies the claim, the claimant is still obligated to play any announced or recorded
move. The director awards the opponent two extra minutes. See also 14C3, Player must be on move; 14C4, Claim
after moving without pressing clock; and 14C7, Irrevocability of claim.
14C3. Player must be on move.
Only a player to move may claim a draw under 14C. If the opponent is on move a player may not claim, and any
claim the player may have made before pressing the clock is invalid; however, the claim is then considered a draw
offer (14C7). The right to claim is restored to that player if the same position appears again with the same player on
move, or if any other position appears for at least the third time with the same player on move. See also 14B,
Agreement.
14C4. Claim after moving without pressing clock.
A player who moves and then does not press the clock (5H), but allows it to run, retains the right to claim a draw
under 14C. However, this procedure is not recommended. The player who moves and allows the clock to run will
lose the time that elapses before a ruling if the claim is not upheld. It is preferred that the player stops both clocks
(5I) in order to retain the right to claim a draw under 14C.
14C5. Claimant’s clock continues to run.
If a player who claims a draw under 14C fails to stop the clocks, the director should instruct the player to stop them.
14C6. Resolution of claim.
If the claim is found to be correct, the game is drawn. If the claim is found to be incorrect, two minutes shall be
added to the opponent’s remaining unused time.
14C7. Irrevocability of claim.
A player who makes a draw claim under 14C cannot withdraw it; however, it is still considered a draw offer (14). If
a player moves, then claims a draw and presses the clock (5H), or claims a draw, then moves and presses the clock,
the move stands, and this is considered an offer of a draw (14). See also 14B, Agreement.
14C8. Sudden death time pressure.
In sudden death, a player with less than five minutes remaining may be awarded a draw by triple occurrence of
position based on the observation of a director, deputy, or impartial witness(es). A player may stop both clocks to
see a director in order to demonstrate the ability to force a triple occurrence of position. See also 14C, Triple
occurrence of position.
14C9. Claimant’s scoresheet.
Except for 14C8, the claimant must have a scoresheet adequate (13C7) to demonstrate the validity of the claim.
14D. Insufficient material to continue.
The game is drawn when one of the following endings exists as of the most recently determined legal move, in
which the possibility of a win is excluded for either side (effective 1-1-19). See also 15H, Reporting of results:
TD TIP: Remember a 14D draw claim is first a draw offer (Rule 14, The Drawn Game).
14D1. King vs. king.
King vs. king.
14D2. King vs. king with bishop or knight.
King vs. king with bishop or knight.
14D3. King and bishop vs. king and bishop.
King and bishop vs. king and bishop, with both bishops on diagonals of the same color.
14D4. No legal moves leading to checkmate by opponent.
There are no legal moves that could lead to the player being checkmated by the opponent.
14E. Insufficient material to win on time.
The game is drawn even when a player exceeds the time limit if one of the following conditions exists as of the most
recently determined legal move (effective 1-1-19) See also 15H, Reporting of results:
TD TIP: Remember a 14E draw claim is first a draw offer (Rule 14, The Drawn Game).
14E1. Lone king.
Opponent has only a lone king.
14E2. King and bishop or king and knight.
Opponent has only king and bishop or king and knight, and does not have a forced win.
14E3. King and two knights.
Opponent has only king and two knights, the player has no pawns, and opponent does not have a forced win.
14F. The 50-move rule.
TD TIP: Remember a 14F draw claim is first a draw offer (Rule 14, The Drawn Game).
TD TIP: a 14F draw claim whould only use the standards outlined in 14F. The standards for a triple occurance of
position claim, particularly Rule 13C7, Definition of reasonably complete scoresheet, do not apply here.
14F1. Explanation.
The game is drawn when the player on move claims a draw and demonstrates that the last 50 consecutive moves
have been made by each side without any capture or pawn move. If the director wishes to allow more than 50 moves
for certain positions, details must be posted at the tournament before the first round. See also 15H, Reporting of
results.
14F2. Resolution.
If the claim is found to be correct, the game is drawn. If it is found to be incorrect, two minutes shall be added to the
opponent’s remaining unused time.
14F3. Winning position irrelevant.
If a valid claim exists, the game is drawn regardless of the position. Even if the opponent can show an immediate
checkmate, the game is drawn.
14F4. Director may count moves in sudden death.
In sudden death, a player with fewer than five minutes remaining and a simplified position in which no pawn moves
or captures seem likely may stop both clocks, declare to a director an intention to invoke the 50-move rule when
possible, and ask for assistance in counting moves. A director who agrees this is appropriate may count moves or
use a deputy or a clock with a move counter to do so.
a. If the director or the deputy will count moves, the count should begin by crediting moves already made and
listed on the scoresheet of the player intending to claim. An opponent who believes a different number of
moves have been made should present this case if and when the count reaches 50.
b. The director or deputy may either keep score, make check marks, or combine the two.
c. After the count by the director or deputy begins, neither player has a right to know the count until 50 moves
are reached. At that point the game is declared drawn unless the opponent successfully challenges the move
count.
d. The opponent may challenge either the moves on the claimant’s scoresheet before the director/deputy
count, the count itself, or both, but must have a scoresheet adequate (13C7) to support the challenge.
e. If the challenge is upheld, the game shall continue with the director or deputy resuming from the corrected
count. If the claimant’s scoresheet is responsible for the wrong count, two minutes shall be added to the
remaining unused time of the claimant’s opponent. If the director/deputy count was wrong, there shall be
no time adjustment.
f. The director may insert a clock with a move counter that shows the remaining time of both players, set the
move counter to zero, and order play to resume. When the clock indicates that both sides have completed
50 further moves, either player may claim a draw. If this method is used, the director should inform the
players that if a move is erroneously not counted or double counted, the players should stop the clock and
notify the director.
14G. Both flags down in sudden death.
The game is drawn if both flags are down in a sudden death time control and either player points this out. If a player
whose flag is still up claims a win on time but does not stop the clock in time to prevent the flag from falling, the
game is drawn, unless the flag fall was observed by a director or independent witness. See also 14G2, Players
apparently unaware of situation; 15H, Reporting of results; 16T, Both players exceed time control; and 16Y,
Assisting players with time management prohibited.
TD TIP: Remember a 14G draw claim is first a draw offer (Rule 14, The Drawn Game).
TD TIP: An increment time control of 30 seconds or more is not considered sudden death; therefore, 14G does not
apply.
14G1. Checkmate and both flags down.
In a sudden death control, if a player points out that both flags are down prior to a checkmate, the game is drawn.
After considering all available evidence, including testimony by the players and any witnesses, a director who is
unable to determine whether the claim of both flags down occurred first shall deny the time claim and rule the
checkmate valid.
14G2. Players apparently unaware of situation.
If a sudden death game continues with both flags down, the director may rule it a draw. This exception to the
standard rule that only players may call flags down is justified by the need to avoid delaying the tournament. See
also 14J, Draw declared by director; 16T, Both players exceed time control; 16Y, Assisting players with time
management prohibited; 18G, Adjudications; and 21D, Intervening in games.

TD TIP: An increment time control of 30 seconds or more is not considered sudden death; therefore, 14G does not
apply.
14H. Claim of insufficient losing chances in sudden death.
No claim of insufficient losing chances in sudden death will be allowed.
Variation 14H. Claim of insufficient losing chances in sudden death.
This variation need not be announced in advance publicity.
14H1. Explanation.
This procedure is not available for games in which a clock is being used with either the time delay or the increment
properly set, whether the game begins with such a clock or one is added during the game (14H2a). If such a clock is
not being used, or such a clock is being used without the time delay or increment feature in operation, the following
procedure is available.
In a sudden death time control, a player on the move with two minutes or less of remaining time may stop the clock
and may make a claim of insufficient losing chances.
14H2. Resolution of Variation 14H claim.
When ruling, the director should not consider the ratings of those playing. A low-rated player who claims a draw vs.
a Master should obtain the same ruling as a Master with the same position who claims a draw vs. a low-rated player.
The director should also not consider the times on the clocks. See also 14H3, Conferring with players.
The director has four possible ways to resolve the claim.
TD TIP: Except for rule 5F5 there is no rule allowing players to ask for a properly set delay clock to be placed on
their game, which would replace an analog clock or an improperly set delay or increment clock. Only the TD can
initiate placing a clock with time delay capabilities on a game after a Variation 14H claim has been made and the
steps of 14H2 have been applied. As a result, the player wishing to place a time delay clock on the game must first
make a Variation 14H claim.
TD TIP: Remember a Variation 14H draw claim is first a draw offer (Rule 14, The Drawn Game).

###### 14H2a. The claim is unclear and a delay clock is available for the game.

A director who believes the claim is neither clearly correct (14H2c) nor clearly incorrect (14H2d), but is instead
uncertain as to the correctness of the claim, may place a delay clock on the game, setting it as follows: The claimant
gets half of the claimant’s remaining time (rounded to the nearest second); the opponent’s time is unadjusted; the
time delay is set for the standard delay announced at the start of the tournament. After the claimant’s clock is started,
the Variation 14H draw request by the claimant becomes a draw offer under 14B3, Draw offer before moving.
Penalties for rule infractions remain standard. The claimant may win, lose, or draw the game.
14H2b. The claim is unclear and a delay clock is not available for the game.
A director who believes the claim is neither clearly correct (14H2c) nor clearly incorrect (14H2c), but is uncertain as
to the correctness of the claim, and does not have a delay clock available, may:
1. Deny the claim while inviting a later re-claim. There is no adjustment of either player’s time. After the claimant’s
clock is started, the Variation 14H draw request by the claimant becomes a draw offer under 14B3, Draw offer
before moving. Penalties for rule infractions remain standard. The claimant may win, lose, or draw the game.
2. Watch the game while reserving judgment on the claim. The director should make every effort to resolve the
claim before the flag of either player falls (5G). There is no adjustment of either player’s time. After the claimant’s
clock is started, the Variation 14H draw request by the claimant also becomes a draw offer under under 14B3, Draw
offer before moving. Penalties for rule infractions remain standard. The claimant may win, lose, or draw the game.
14H2c. The claim is clearly correct.
A director who believes the claim is clearly correct should declare the game drawn. The draw shall be awarded if the
director believes that a Class C player would have little chance to lose the position against a Master with both
players having ample time. The exact losing chances of any position cannot be calculated, but a director wishing a
more precise standard may consider little to mean less than 10 percent. A director unsure whether a position meets
the above standard should use option 14H2a or 14H2b. See also 14I, Advice on claims of insufficient losing chances
in sudden death under rule Variation 14H.
14H2d. The claim is clearly incorrect.
A director who believes the claim is clearly incorrect should deny the claim and may subtract up to one minute from
the claimant’s remaining time. After the claimant’s clock is started, the Variation 14H draw request by the claimant
also becomes a draw offer under 14B3, Draw offer before moving. Penalties for rule infractions remain standard.
The claimant may win, lose, or draw the game. See also 14I, Advice on claims of insufficient losing chances in
sudden death under rule Variation 14H.
TD TIP: If a director chooses to resolve the claim by enforcing 14H2a, The claim is unclear, a delay clock is
available for the game, or 14H2b, The claim is unclear, a delay clock is not available for the game, then the director
should inform the claimant and opponent that when the claimant’s clock is started that rule 14B3, Draw offer before
moving, is in effect. The opponent has the right to ask the claimant to make a move before the draw offer is rejected
or accepted by the opponent; however, if the claimant makes a checkmating (13A) or stalemating (14A) move, the
game is over.
TD TIP: Applying rule 14H2a, The claim is unclear, a delay clock is available for the game, is the preferred
method of resolving a Variation 14H claim for directors who wish to ensure the result of the game is determined by
the players, rather than any outside influence.
14H3. Conferring with players.
A director who is unsure how to rule may confer privately with either player or with both players separately
regarding the player’s plans. The director should be careful not to say anything that might assist the player if the
game is resumed.
14H4. Player with fallen flag may not claim.
A player whose flag is down (5G) may not claim insufficient losing chances.
14H5. Delay Clock, a clock with time delay capabilities, or Increment clock, a clock with increment
capabilities.
If either a properly set Delay Clock (5F) or a properly set Increment Clock is used, Variation Variation 14H and 14I
are not in effect; i.e., no claim of insufficient losing chances may be made. The reaction time provided for by the
delay or the added increment time for each move is likely to be sufficient for a player with insufficient losing
chances to hold the position.
14I. Advice on claims of insufficient losing chances in sudden death under Rule Variation
14H.
14I1. Consulting strong players.
If the director is unsure about how to rule on a Variation 14H claim, the director may consult a Master or nearMaster who has no stake in the outcome of the game in question. The director should be careful to explain the
conditions of Variation 14H to such a player.
14I2. Types of positions.
In complex positions often neither side has a valid claim, while in simple positions both sides may have one. For
instance, with much material on the board a Master may be down a piece without compensation but still has better
than a small chance to beat a C player. But in endings such as described in 14I3, even a player behind in material
should sometimes be awarded the draw.
14I3. Opposite-colored bishop endings.
In some opposite-colored bishop endings (one player having a light-squared bishop and the other player a darksquared bishop) with most or all pawns fixed, a Master, even if a pawn or two ahead, may have little chance to
outplay a C-player; these positions should be ruled draws.
14I4. Queen vs. queen, rook vs. rook.
With no pawns and queen vs. queen or rook vs. rook, the draw should be awarded unless it is one of the rare
positions in which there is a quick forced win. If the claimant has additional material and the opponent does not, the
ruling should still ordinarily be a draw.
14I5. Bishop or knight vs. rook, rook vs. rook and knight, queen vs. queen and bishop or knight.
With no pawns the player behind in material should not be awarded a draw, but it may be appropriate for the
director to apply Variation 14H2a or Variation 14H2b.
14I6. King vs. king, rook pawn, and possibly bishop.
A player with a lone king should be awarded a draw vs. king and rook pawn, or king, rook pawn, and bishop
controlling squares of the opposite color than the promotion square, if the claimant’s king can stop the pawn from
promoting. As in 14I4 and all other such cases, if the claimant has additional material, the ruling should still
ordinarily be a draw.
14I7. Rook vs. rook and bishop.
With no pawns, unless there is an immediate win of material or an unusual problem position, a draw claim with a
rook vs. opponent’s rook and bishop should be denied in accordance with Variation 14H2d. The claim is clearly
incorrect.
14J. Draw declared by director.
On rare occasions the director may encounter a situation in which a ruling is required and a decision in favor of
either player would be unfair to the opponent (for examples see 20E2d and 20E2h). In such situations the director
may rule a draw on the grounds that this is more equitable (i.e., less inequitable) than any other ruling. A draw may
also be ruled in cases like 19E, Sealed move envelope missing, if the director recalls that the position was about
equal but does not remember the exact position or clock times. See also 1C2, Director discretion; 14G2, Players
apparently unaware of situation; 16T, Both players exceed time control; 16Y, Assisting players with time
management prohibited; 18G, Adjudications, 21D, Intervening in games; and 21K, Use of director’s power.
14K. Director declares draw for lack of progress.
If one or both of the following occur(s) then the TD may declare the game drawn:
1. The same position has appeared, as in 14C, for at least five consecutive alternate moves by each
player.
2. Any consecutive series of 75 moves have been completed by each player without the movement of
any pawn and without any capture. If the last move resulted in checkmate, that shall take
precedence
15. The Recording of Games
15A. Manner of keeping score.
In the course of play each player is required to record the game (both the player’s and the opponent’s moves), move
after move, as clearly and legibly as possible, on the scoresheet prescribed for the competition. Algebraic notation is
standard, but descriptive or computer notation is permitted. The player must first make the move, and then record it
on the scoresheet. The scoresheet shall be visible to the arbiter (tournament directors) and the opponent throughout
the game. See also Chapter 3, Chess Notation; 13C3, Filling in moves with flag down; 13I, Refusal to obey rules;
35F6, Scorekeeping options; and 43, Scoresheets.
TD TIP: While the rule’s wording indicates making the move first and keeping the scoresheet (paper or electronic)
visible at all times, it brings US Chess in alignment with FIDE procedures and sooths many of the fears surrounding
electronic scoresheets—see Rule 43— it is a huge change for many players. TDs are advised to first (and possibly
second and third) issue warnings to players that do not comply with this revised rule before enforcing any time
penalties (1C2a. prescribes adding two minutes to the opponent’s unused time).
15A. (Variation I) Paper scoresheet variation.
The player using a paper scoresheet may first make the move, and then write it on the scoresheet, or vice versa. This
variation does not need to be advertised in advance. The scoresheet shall be visible to the arbiter (tournament
directors) and the opponent throughout the game.
TD TIP: TDs may penalize a player that is in violation of 20C, Use of notes prohibited if the player is first writing
the move and repeatedly altering that move on their scoresheet before completing a move on the board.
TD TIP: When TDs enforce the “visible scoresheet” portion of this rule they are advised to first warn players that
do not make their scoresheet (or score keeping device) visible to the TD and their opponent.
15A1. Players unable to keep score.
a. Players determined by the director to be unable to keep score due to physical handicaps may have
assistance in scorekeeping as described in 35F, Rules for visually impaired and disabled players, and
should be excused from scorekeeping if such assistance is unavailable.
b. Players determined by the director to be unable to keep score for religious reasons may be excused from
scorekeeping or permitted to have assistance as in 35F, Rules for visually impaired and disabled players, at
the director’s discretion.
c. Beginners who have not learned to keep score may be excused from scorekeeping, at the director’s
discretion.
Players excused from scorekeeping are not entitled to make claims that require scoresheets; those who have
assistance retain such rights.
TD TIP: Directors often deduct time from the clocks of players at the start of the game whom they excuse from
keeping score (the most common example would be that of a player excused from keeping score for genuine
religious reasons). Their opponents will need to give up thinking time in order to keep score, which the excused
player need not do. A good rule of thumb is to deduct 5% of the total game time allotted for each individual player,
up to 10 minutes, from the player’s clock that is excused from keeping score. Unless a clock is being used that can
be set with seconds as well as minutes and hours (usually a digital clock), partial minutes should be rounded to the
nearest minute. For example, in a 20/60 SD/30 contest the player excused from keeping score would lose 5 minutes
(5%×90 minutes = 4.5 minutes, rounded to 5 minutes) on an analog clock and 4.5 minutes on a digital clock with
that capability. In a 30/60 SD/60 game that same player would lose 6 minutes (5%×120 minutes = 6 minutes) on
both an analog and digital clock. In a G/45 contest that same player would lose 2 minutes (5%×45 minutes = 2.25
minutes, rounded to 2 minutes) on an analog clock and 2.25 minutes on a digital clock with that capability. A
40/120 20/60 game can exceed 200 minutes of playing time, as long as 20 moves are made every hour after the first
time control; therefore, that same player would lose no more than 10 minutes (5%×200 minutes = 10 minutes or
5%×300 minutes = 15 minutes, which is rounded to 10 minutes because it exceeds the 10 minute maximum limit).
15B. Scorekeeping in time pressure, non-sudden death time control.
If either player has less than five minutes remaining in a non-sudden death time control and does not have additional
time (increment) of 30 seconds or more added with each move, both players are excused from the obligation to keep
score until the end of the time control period. Doing so, however, may make it impossible to claim a draw by triple
occurrence of position (14C) or the 50-move rule (14F) or a win on time forfeit (13C). Scorekeeping by both players
must resume with the start of the next time control period, and missing moves should be filled in (15F).
TD TIP: Only players in games with increment time controls of 30 seconds or more and using properly set
increment capable clocks are required to keep score at all times, even in the last five minutes of any time control
period. Players using improperly set increment clocks or non-increment capable clocks, even those clocks adjusted
for an increment time control, are regulated by Rule 15B
15C. Scorekeeping in time pressure, sudden death time control.
If either player has less than five minutes remaining in a sudden death time control and does not have additional
time (increment) of 30 seconds or more added with each move, both players are excused from the obligation to keep
score. A scoresheet is not required to win on time in a sudden death control (13C).
TD TIP: Only players in games with increment time controls of 30 seconds or more and using properly set
increment capable clocks are required to keep score at all times, even in the last five minutes of any time control
period. Players using improperly set increment clocks or non-increment capable clocks, even those clocks adjusted
for an increment time control, are regulated by Rule 15C.
15D. Use of opponent’s scoresheet for assistance.
A player who has an incomplete scoresheet (13C7) and wishes to consult the opponent’s scoresheet for assistance
may ask to borrow it from the opponent under the following conditions:
15D1. Clock times.
Both players have at least five minutes remaining in the current time control.
15D2. Borrower’s clock runs.
The clock of the player making such a request is running and shall continue to run until the scoresheet has been
returned.
15D3. Compliance.
The opponent is urged to comply with such a request, but this is not mandatory. If the opponent denies the request,
the player may stop both clocks and see a director. A director who agrees that the request is appropriate shall instruct
the opponent to lend the player the scoresheet. The opponent may not refuse as all scoresheets belong to the
organizers. See also 15G, Ownership of scoresheets.
15D4. Excessive requests.
Repeated requests of this type may be deemed by the director to be inappropriate, and the offender may be penalized
under 20G, Annoying behavior prohibited.
15E. Borrowing not needed.
A player who is able to read the opponent’s scoresheet without borrowing it is free to use the information gained for
assistance in keeping score.
15F. Reconstruction after time control.
After the end of a time control, if the next control is not sudden-death, each player must make all efforts to fill in any
missing moves on that player’s scoresheet.
15F1. Reconstruction of scoresheet by one player.
After the completion of a time control, a player who alone has to complete the scoresheet must do so before making
another move, and with that player’s clock running if the opponent has made a move. An additional set and board
may be used.
15F2. Reconstruction of scoresheets by both players.
After the completion of a time control, if both players need to complete their scoresheets, the clocks should be
stopped until they are completed. Additional chess sets and boards may be used. This does not apply if the director
rules that it is unnecessary. See also 15F4, Reconstruction when the next time control is sudden death.
15F3. Reconstruction impossible or unnecessary.
If it is impossible or unnecessary to reconstruct the moves as prescribed above, the game shall continue. The players
should make a clear diagram of the position reached, and the next move played will be considered the first one of
the following time control unless the players agree that a later move number has been reached.
TD TIP: For example: in a 40/90 20/30 game both players were in time trouble in the first time control and blitzed
off many moves. Both players agree that they made time control but cannot reconstruct the game to reach the
current board position. The position is diagrammed and the players continue from that position with the next move
by White being move number 41 (or another move number greater than 40 if both players agree). The scoresheet
from that point forward is considered complete (13C7) in order to make any claim including a draw by triple
occurrence of position (14C) or the 50-move rule (14F) or a win on time forfeit (13C).
15F4. Reconstruction when the next time control is sudden death.
Upon making the time control, if the next control is sudden death, it is less important to fill in the missing moves.
The director has the option of waiving the requirement of reconstructing.
15G. Ownership of scoresheets.
The scoresheets of all games in a tournament are the property of the sponsoring organization(s). If the organizer
requires that a copy of each game score be submitted by the players, duplicate scoresheets must be provided, and
players who fail to submit scoresheets may be penalized.
15H. Reporting of results.
When a game is completed, the result must be immediately reported in the manner required by the director. Both
players, not just the winner, are responsible for registering the result. If they do not do so, they may each be
penalized. See also 29H, Unreported results.
15I. Results reported incorrectly.
If the director learns of the correct result for any just-completed round either before or just after pairings have been
made for the next round, the director should correct the pairings if this can be done without disturbing too many
games already in progress. The correction may either be based on the correct result or on treating the incorrectly
reported result as an unreported result (29H), at the director’s discretion. Whichever of these is chosen, the result
must be corrected before pairing subsequent rounds, if any, and the corrected result shall be used for prize purposes.
If the error occurred in an earlier round, other than the round described above, the director shall still proceed as
above, but has discretion as to whether to use the correct result or the incorrect result for prize purposes. This
decision should be based on how much earlier in the tournament the error occurred and how many pairings were
affected.
TD TIP: Sometimes errors occur in the reporting of game results. Those errors need to be corrected immediately.
Fortunately the same methods used to correct unreported game results also work very well for incorrectly reported
game results. The difficulty arises when incorrectly reported results do not come to the director’s attention until
after several rounds, or even the end of the tournament. As long as there is no chance of a prize being involved,
correcting the results is easy. When prizes or a chance to win a prize are involved the director should take care.
Correcting incorrectly reported results that cause a player, paired in easier score groups for many rounds, to
suddenly qualify for a prize seems unfair. It is the player’s responsibility to check the wall charts for errors. While
there is no question that such an incorrect result should be rated, the director needs to decide on a case-by-case
basis whether or not to allow the new correct results to affect the awarding of prizes.

### 16. The Use of the Chess Clock

#### 16A. Allowable time controls.

The US Chess office maintains a list, available on request, directly from the US Chess office or at www.uschess.org,
of the currently allowable time limits for different types of tournaments. See also 5C, Ratable time controls.

### 16B. How to set clocks.

#### 16B1. Analog clocks.

Clocks should be set so that each unit will register six o’clock when the first time-control period expires. If there is a
second time control of any length of one hour or less it should expire at seven o’clock (even if that requires that the
clocks be reset), a third such control at eight o’clock, etc. See also 5F1a, Increment capable clock not available;
5F2a, Delay capable clock not available; 35F5, Special Clock.
16B2. Digital clocks.
Time delay or increment clocks should be set according to the manufacturer’s directions so that any visual device
used to indicate that a player’s time has been exhausted for all time control periods is activated. Such mechanisms
may include one or more of a light, a display of all zeros, or a display of a flag. Players should explain the flag fall
mechanism and the clock’s operation to their opponents. The time delay or increment should be set according to the
director’s instructions, with the time delay or increment in force starting at move one (5E1) unless the time control
specifies otherwise. Clocks equipped to do so should be set for a Bronstein or a delay mode for delay controls or for
Fischer, added time, or increment mode for increment time controls.
16B2a. Sound.
Digital clocks must be set to produce no sound. This includes, but is not limited to: beeping when a player has run
out of time in the final time control; beeping when a player reaches the end of any time control; warning beeps to
indicate a player is approaching the end of a time control; and beeping when a player presses the clock. A digital
clock that can be set to produce no sound is preferable to a clock that cannot.
16B2b.
Clock of player not out of time continues to run. If possible, digital clocks must be set so that when one player
runs out of time in a time control, the opponent’s clock continues to run normally. This capability is variously called
“halt on end,” “claim mode,” or “freeze.” A digital clock that can be set to satisfy the requirement of this rule is
preferable to a clock that cannot.
16B2c.
Players are responsible for setting clock correctly. Players are responsible for knowing how to set their own
clocks to conform to rule 16B2. Players should be prepared to explain the clock’s operation to the opponent before
the start of the game. This includes how the clock indicates a player has run out of time and how to pause both
clocks if necessary to summon a director. See also 5F7, Players responsible for knowing how to set the clock.
For more information on delay or increment clocks see Chapter 4, Equipment Standards; 5F, Standard Timer; 35F5,
Special clock; 42B, Signaling devices; 42C, Move counters; 42D, Digital clocks; and 42F, Delay clock preferable in
sudden death.
TD TIP: Directors are not expected to know how to set delay or increment clocks (5F) but are encouraged to
review the digital clock link at www.uschess.org.
TD TIP: Some players due to incapacity or due to religious reasons cannot use some types of clocks such as
electric, electronic or with digital displays. After a director determines that such conditions are genuine, an analog
clock is permissible. Some players for the same reasons cannot use a clock at all. In such cases, the opponent may
be asked, but not required, to press the clock on behalf of both players, a method that some TDs report has worked
well. The TD may also require such a player to provide an assistant, or may help such a player find an assistant
among spectators or players with byes. Directors often deduct time from the clocks of players excused from setting
and pressing the clock. See also the TD TIP after 15A1, Players unable to keep score. 
16C. Removing a player’s hand from clock.
Players must remove their hands from the clock button after depressing the button and must keep their hands off and
away from the clock until it is time to press it again. See also 5H, Pressing the clock.
16C1. Using the clock.
Each player must operate the clock with the same hand that moves the pieces.
16C2. Picking up clock.
Each player is forbidden to pick up the clock.
16D. Special rules for time pressure.
See 11D1, Illegal move in time pressure;15B, Scorekeeping in time pressure, non-sudden death time control and
15C, Scorekeeping in time pressure, sudden death.
16E. When flag is considered down.
The flag is considered to have fallen when either player points this out. See also 5G, The flag and 13C1, Only
players may call flag.
16F. Evidence provided by flag.
In the absence of an evident defect in the clock or flag mechanism, the fallen flag (5G) is considered as proof that
the time-control period has ended or that time has run out for that time period. See also 16G, Premature flag fall and
16H, Apparent flag fall can cause forfeit.
16G. Premature flag fall.
a. With an analog clock, if a clear white space shows between the right side of the minute hand of the clock
and the left side of the 12 marker on the clock’s face, the flag is considered to have fallen prematurely.
b. With a delay clock, if the device used to indicate that a player’s time is exhausted is activated, due to an
incorrect or defective move counter, an incorrect setting, or a defect (16O) of any kind, the flag is
considered to have fallen prematurely. Since the move counters, on clocks equipped with them, may not be
used as the only evidence in claiming that the prescribed number of moves were not completed in the
allotted time (13C), both players’ scoresheets may be used as evidence of an incorrect or defective delay
clock.
If either 16Ga or 16Gb occurs, the director should deny the claim of a time forfeit (13C) and the game is
continued, with a different clock, if possible. A later time-forfeit claim (13C) in that control by either player is
still allowed.
16H. Apparent flag fall can cause forfeit.
a. Analog clock: even though it may seem that the flag (5G) fell early, if the clear white space described in
16Ga is not apparent, the player’s time has expired.
TD TIP: For instance, if the right side of the minute hand is touching the left side of the hour marker, even though it
may not reach to the center of that marker, the time has been used up. Players should realize that this possibility
exists and should refrain from using all their apparent time if not essential.
b. Delay clock: because each delay clock manufacturer applies the delay and flag fall procedures in slightly
different ways, it may then appear that the flag fell early as described in 16Gb; however, the player’s time
has expired.
16I. Starting the clock.
At the time determined for the start of the game, after the board and pieces are set up, the clock of the player with
the white pieces is started. During the game, each of the players, having moved, stops the player’s clock and starts
that of the opponent. See also 5H, Pressing the clock and 16N, Beginning the round.
16J. Black not present.
If Black is not present for the start of the game, White shall start his own clock, make his move on the board, and
start Black’s clock.
TD TIP: If a director observes that White has started Black’s clock without moving, the director should remind
White to make a move immediately. If, upon arriving, Black observes that White has started Black’s clock without
moving, Black may immediately start White’s clock or stop the clock and make a claim. Either way, if the clock has
a move counter, it may be necessary to adjust it before the game commences. The director may assess the standard
penalty (1C2A), or other penalties if appropriate, against the player who improperly started Black’s clock without
moving.
If White makes a move before the clock is started, the move counter may be off by a half-move. If White starts
Black’s clock without moving, the counter may be off by a half-move or a full move. The director should, at an early
stage in the game, verify the setting of the move counter, and ask the players to correct it if necessary.
16K. Both players late.
If both players arrive late, the first to arrive must split the elapsed time before starting the opponent’s clock. For
example, if the first player to arrive is 40 minutes late, the clocks should be set to reflect 20 minutes of elapsed time
on each side. See also 13F, Late arrival by both players; and 13D, Late arrival for game.
16K1. Elapsed time not reflected.
If the first late player to arrive fails to do this and instead sets the clocks to reflect no elapsed time on either side, this
setting stands unless corrected by a director or changed by agreement between the two players.
16K2. Elapsed time incorrectly reflected.
If the first late player to arrive sets the clocks to give the opponent a disadvantage, such as charging the opponent
with all the elapsed time, and this is noticed by or pointed out to the director, the improper times shall be corrected
and the player responsible for them penalized at the director’s discretion.
16L. Possible stipulations.
The director may require that clocks face a certain direction or that Black or White sit on a particular side of the
table. In the absence of such a requirement, unless Black is late arriving for the start of the game (39A1), Black
determines which side of the board the clock is on, and the player arriving at the chessboard first may choose either
side of the table to sit on. See also 39A1, Black player late.
16M. Equipment needed to start clock.
Except for splitting the elapsed time if both players are late or lack equipment, no player may subtract time from a
late opponent except by starting a clock. A late opponent’s clock may not be started until the board and pieces are in
place. If equipment becomes available only after the round has started, the elapsed time from the beginning shall be
divided equally between the two players. See also 13F, Late arrival by both players and 13D, Late arrival for game.
16N. Beginning the round.
With the exception of games rescheduled by the director, all clocks should start promptly at the time specified for
the round. If feasible, the director should give a warning and then announce that play must begin. In a tournament
where it is impractical for the director to announce that play should start, players should be urged in advance to
begin games promptly and informed that no permission is needed to start clocks at the specified time if the pairings
are posted. See also 5H, Pressing the clock; 6A, The first move; and 16I, Starting the clock.

#### 16O. Defective clocks.

Every indication given by a clock is considered to be conclusive in the absence of evident defects. A player who
wishes to claim any such defect must do so as soon as aware of it. A clock with an obvious defect should be
replaced, and the time used by each player up to that time should be indicated on the new clock as accurately as
possible.
The director should use judgment in determining what times shall be shown on the new clock. A director who
decides to subtract time from one or both players shall leave that player(s) with the greater of either five minutes to
the time control or at least one minute for each move the player still needs to meet the time control.
16P. Erroneously set clocks.
An erroneously set clock should be handled in the same fashion as a defective clock. As in 16O, the director should
use judgment in deciding whether to make time adjustments. The most common situation of this type involves an
analog clock set to expire at 7:00 rather than the correct 6:00. This is best handled by pointing out to both players
that the time control expires at 7:00. Clocks can also be reset for the correct time controls and the correct elapsed
time for each player.
Sometimes this hour difference is not pointed out and there is an eventual time claim. Even though the clock may
show 6:00 with a flag down, or the signaling device on a delay or digital clock indicates a flag fall, if the total
elapsed time shown for both players is about an hour more than possible, considering when the game started, the
player should not be forfeited, and should be given the hour in question.
TD TIP: Often digital and delay clocks are a challenge to set properly. The director should use judgment in
deciding if a digital or delay clock was set improperly deliberately, or inadvertently. Adding two minutes to the
injured player’s unused time should penalize deliberate incorrect settings. In either case the error(s) should be
corrected. If the players cannot adjust the digital or delay clock properly then an analog clock with the proper
settings may be used instead. A few common errors in setting digital and delay clocks: (1) using the “Fischer”
instead of the proper “Bronstein” setting, (2) secondary sudden death time controls that are set improperly or not at
all, and (3) inaccurate move counters.
TD TIP: Directors are encouraged to intervene in the game to correct an incorrectly set clock without requiring a
player to make a claim first. Incorrectly set clocks can cause multiple problems for the entire tournament. This
intervention is best done early in the game.
16P1. Delay or increment not set.
If a delay- or increment-capable clock is used at an event with a delay or increment time control and the delay or
increment is not set, this is handled in the same fashion as an erroneously set clock. The delay or increment should
be set for the remainder of the game. The director should use his or her best judgement when determining the clock
settings.
16Q. Interruption of game.
If the game is to be interrupted for some reason beyond the control of the players, such as a defective clock,
disruption of the pieces, re-establishing the position after an illegal move, making the claim of a draw or win or a
rules violation, or for any other reason that assistance by the tournament director may be required both clocks should
be stopped by one of the players. When doing so, the player must state the reason for stopping the clocks, and see
the director if necessary to resolve the situation. See also 5I, Stopping the clock; 13C6, Claimant’s clock; 21F,
Player requests for rulings; and 21F1, Timing of requests.
16R. Illegal Moves
See 11A, Illegal move during last 10 moves;11D, Illegal move; and 16Q, Interruption of game.
16S. Priority of agreed result over time-forfeit claim.
A resignation or an agreement to draw remains valid even when it is found later that the flag of one side had fallen.
See also 13B, Resignation; 14B, Agreement; and 19G1, Agreed draw and invalid move.
16T. Both players exceed time control.
If both players exceed the time control, no claim of time forfeit is possible. In a non-sudden death control, the game
continues. In a sudden death control, the game is drawn. See also 13C6, Claimants clock; 13C13, Player out of time
cannot claim; 14G, Both flags down in sudden death; 14G2, Players apparently unaware of situation; and 16Y,
Assisting players with time management prohibited.
TD TIP: An increment time control of 30 seconds or more is not considered sudden death, therefore if both players
should exceed time control, the clocks should be reset to the “next” time control of the time increment (e.g. 30
seconds) per move.
16U. Avoiding the need to reset clocks.
It is recommended for analog clocks that secondary and subsequent time controls allow one hour per player so that
the minute hand will be at twelve (12:00) and the flag will fall when the player’s time expires. This avoids the need
to reset clocks and the problems sometimes caused by resetting. The latter include questions or disputes about player
resetting, directors being diverted from other duties to reset, time shortage situations with no flags when players
forget to reset, and players whose flags have just fallen resetting the clock before the opponent claims a forfeit win.
Check the manufacture’s manual for instructions on properly setting a delay clock to reset automatically after the
end of the first time control. See also 16B, How to set clocks and 16W, resetting clocks when necessary.
16V. One vs. two controls when time is limited.
If there is not enough time for a second control of an hour per player, it is recommended the tournament have only
one control unless the organizer believes the players would prefer otherwise. For instance, if games must end in two
hours, G/60 should be preferred to 30/30 followed by SD/30 unless players have indicated a preference for the latter.
16W. Resetting clocks when necessary.
When using an analog clock, if a period of less than one hour is used for a second or later control period, when both
players complete the number of moves required of the previous time-control period, the players should reset both
clocks by moving them forward one hour minus the length of the next time-control period. The director may specify
alternate procedures. With a few exceptions, properly set digital clocks usually reset automatically. See also 16B,
How to set clocks and 16U, Avoiding the need to reset clocks.
16X. Extra minute not added.
The old rule permitting an extra minute on each side of a mechanical (analog) clock to compensate for possible
inaccuracies is no longer in effect.
16Y. Assisting players with time management prohibited.
No one, except a player’s opponent, may call that player’s attention to the fact that a flag is down, the opponent has
moved, or the player has forgotten to press the clock after moving. These prohibitions also apply to the director. For
a rare exception regarding calling flags in sudden death, see 14G2, Players apparently unaware of situation. See also
1C2, Director discretion; 11I, Spectators; 13CI, Only players may call flag; 14J, Draw declared by director; 18G2,
Director declares game over; 20E2, Unsolicited advice; 20M5, Spectators cannot make claims; 21D, Intervening in
games; and 21K, Use of director’s power.
17. Scheduling
17A. Determination of game times.
All games must be played in the tournament rooms at the times designated by the organizers unless the director
specifies otherwise. For example, a player whose game ends late or is adjourned may be granted additional time to
eat or rest (a half hour is common), or a first-round game may be scheduled for play before the start of the
tournament. See also 23B, Determination of game times.
17B. Delayed games.
If the director grants a player a late start, the opponent may not start the player’s clock until the time specified by the
director.
17B1. Informing opponent of new time.
The director should inform the opponent of a player allowed a delayed start of the revised starting time, either by
writing the new time on the pairing sheet or by telling the player involved.
17B2. Opponent not informed of new time.
If the director fails to provide the notice described in 17B1, the opponent presumably will start the player’s clock at
the originally scheduled time. In such cases, the opponent will eventually be required to reset the clocks to reflect
the revised starting time and grant the player the time promised by the director.
17C. Changes in round times.
Changes in starting times of rounds should be made only in the event of an emergency. It is especially undesirable to
make rounds earlier than previously scheduled, as players may forfeit or lose time as a result.
18. The Adjournment of the Game
18A. Description.
If a game is not finished at the end of the time prescribed for play, the director may indicate that it is time for
adjournment or accept the request of either player to adjourn. At that point the player on move, after deciding which
move to make, does not play that move on the board but instead writes it in unambiguous notation on the scoresheet,
puts the scoresheet and that of the opponent in the sealed move envelope (18D), seals the envelope, stops both
clocks, and then records the remaining time on the outside of the envelope.
Until stopping both clocks the player retains the right to change the sealed move. If the player who is told to adjourn
makes a move on the chessboard, for whatever reason, that move becomes the sealed move and cannot be changed.
See also 9A, Transfer to a vacant square.
If either player is recording the game in a scorebook, the director may take possession of the entire score book or
allow the sealed move to be written on a separate piece of paper and sealed in the envelope.
18B. Sealing a move early.
In tournaments in which the adjournment time is fixed beforehand, normally after the full period of the first time
control, a player who has completed the number of moves required may ask the director for permission to seal early.
Such a player absorbs the time remaining before the scheduled adjournment by having his or her remaining time
decreased by the amount of time remaining in the session. Such requests are ordinarily granted during the last hour
of the session.
18C. When to adjourn.
Unless announcing in advance that all games will adjourn at a specific time, the director has discretion as to when to
adjourn any game after the first time control. The wall clock shall control the duration of all playing sessions, but the
director should refrain from adjourning a game in which one or both players are in serious time trouble. This
situation could arise, for example, if the game was started late and half the elapsed time before the start was not
deducted from each clock.
18C1. Adjournment despite time pressure.
If it is necessary for the start of the next round, a game may be adjourned in a secondary time-control period in
which one player is short of time but the other has a large amount. The director should be aware that despite the time
pressure of one player, the game might not end soon, delaying the start of the next round.
18C2. Allowing breaks.

In tournaments with more than one round per day, it is customary to allow a player whose game has just been
adjourned a standard amount of time to eat or rest (a half hour is common) before beginning the next game. On
occasion, this may require the next round opponent to start that game after the regularly scheduled starting time. See
also 17A, Determination of game times.
18D. The sealed move envelope.
The following should be indicated on the sealed move envelope: names and colors of the players, position
immediately before the sealed move, time used by each player, name or color of the player who sealed the move and
number of that move, date and time for resumption, and the signatures of both players, indicating they verify and
understand the information written on the envelope. 
18E. Custody of sealed move envelope.
The director is responsible for custody of the envelope.
18F. Problems of the next-to-last round.
Substantial effort should be made to complete all unfinished games, especially those involving prize contenders,
from previous rounds before the last round begins. This must, however, be balanced by the need to start the final
round as close to the scheduled time as possible.
18F1. Considerations.
When deciding whether to adjourn games in such cases, the director must weigh the harm to other contenders that
might ensue if one of the players loses the final game and then decides to resign the adjourned game, either because
a long delay in resumption seems likely or for unethical reasons. On the other hand, delaying the last round for many
hours can cause immense player dissatisfaction; some in contention may even withdraw rather than wait.
18F2. Pairing players unaffected by result.
A director who does not wish to adjourn a long game may seek private assurances from both players that they will
not withdraw and will play the last round regardless of the result of the long game. This would allow all players to
be paired except those whose pairings would be affected by the result of that game.
18F3. Sudden-death.
Widespread use of sudden-death time controls has minimized the problems associated with last-round pairings. See
also 28Q, Pairing unfinished games and 29F, Last-round pairings with unfinished games.
18G. Adjudications.
Only under emergency circumstances may a director permanently adjudicate a game; that is, declare a result based
upon best play by both sides. When used in other than emergency situations, this fact must be clearly specified in all
tournament publicity and posted and announced at the site. See also 14G2, Players apparently unaware of situation;
14J, Draw declared by director; 16Y, Assisting players with time management prohibited; and 21D, Intervening in
games.
18G1. Example of emergency.
An emergency situation could arise, for example, if a player with substantial time remaining and a poor position
disappears for more than 15 minutes or is present but shows little interest in considering the position. Such behavior
is unsportsmanlike and the director is encouraged to adjudicate, possibly after a warning. See also 1C2, Director
discretion; 20H, Long absence during play; 21F, Player requests for rulings; and 21K, Use of director’s power.
18G2. Director declares game over.
18G does not prevent a director from declaring the result of a game that has ended without the players noticing this.
For example, if the game has been decided by checkmate (13A), late arrival for game (13D), late arrival for
adjournment resumption (13E), stalemate (14A), or insufficient material to continue (14D), the director may declare
the game over. See also 1C2, Director discretion; 13C1, Only players may call flag; 14G2, Players apparently
unaware of situation; 14J, Draw declared by director; 16Y, Assisting players with time management prohibited;
21D, Intervening in games; 21F, Player requests for rulings; and 21K, Use of director’s power.
19. Resumption of the Adjourned Game
19A. Setup.
When the game is resumed, the position immediately before the sealed move shall be set up on the chessboard, and
the times at adjournment shall be indicated on the clocks.
19B. Opening the envelope.
The envelope (18D) shall be opened only when the player who must reply to the sealed move is present. The
director then opens the envelope, makes the sealed move on the chessboard, and starts the player’s clock.
19C. Opponent of sealing player absent.
The clock of an absent player who must respond to the sealed move shall be started at the beginning of the
adjournment session, but the envelope containing the sealed move shall be opened only when the player arrives.
19D. Sealing player absent.
If the player who has sealed the move is absent, the player responding to the sealed move is not obliged to play a
move on the chessboard. Such a player has the right to record the move in reply on the scoresheet, seal it in an
envelope, and press the clock (5H). The envelope should then be given to the director and opened on the opponent’s
arrival.
19E. Sealed move envelope missing.
If the envelope (18D) containing the move recorded in accordance with 18A has disappeared, the game shall be
resumed from the position at the time of adjournment with the clock times as they were at the time of adjournment.
If it is impossible to reestablish the position, the game is annulled, and a new game must be played unless the
director determines either that it is impractical to do so or another solution offers greater equity. If the time used
cannot be reestablished, the director must decide how to reset the clocks. See also 1C2, Director Discretion; 14J,
Draw declared by director; and 21K, Use of director’s power.
19F. Sealed move ambiguous.
A director who feels an ambiguous sealed move has two or more reasonable interpretations may allow the sealer’s
opponent to choose among the possibilities. The sealer’s opponent’s clock will run while considering which to
choose. See also 13H, Sealing of invalid move.
19G. Sealed move invalid.
If the envelope contains no sealed move or the sealed move is illegal and the director finds there is no reasonable
interpretation of it, the player who sealed the move loses the game. See also 13H, Sealing of invalid move.
19G1. Agreed draw and invalid move.
If the players agree to draw and then find that an invalid move was sealed, the draw stands. See 14B, Agreement.
TD TIP: In the cases of an agreed draw or resignation, both players should notify the director. The director should
be alert to the possibility that players may have reached agreement without notifying the director.
19G2. Resignation and invalid move.
If a player resigns (see 19J) and then finds that the opponent sealed an invalid move, the resignation stands. See also
13B, Resignation.
19G3. Loss on time and invalid move.
If the opponent of the player who sealed loses the game due to failure to appear in time for its resumption and then
finds that the sealed move was invalid, the loss on time stands. See 13C, Time forfeit.
19H. Game resumed with wrong times on clock.
If, upon resumption, the times have been incorrectly indicated on either clock, the error must be corrected if either
player points this out before making a move. If the error is not so established, the game continues without any
correction, unless the director determines that another solution offers greater equity.
19I. Game resumed with incorrect position.
If, upon resumption, the position is set up incorrectly, this is considered an illegal move. If discovered within ten
moves of resumption, the position must be corrected. The clock times are not adjusted. See also 11E, Incorrect
adjourned position.
19J. Agreed result of adjourned game.
If both players agree on the result of an adjourned game before resumption, both players must notify the director.
See also 14B, Agreement.
TD TIP: Sometimes the sealed move is mate or stalemate, so the sealed move ends the game; however, this is
considered unsportsmanlike behavior on the part of the player that knowingly sealed such a move. This kind of
behavior may be fined or punished.
20. Conduct of Players and Spectators
20A. Conduct of players.
Players shall participate in the spirit of fair play and good sportsmanship, and must observe the US Chess Code of
Ethics. See also Chapter 6: US Chess Code of Ethics.
20B. Use of recorded matter prohibited.
During play, players are forbidden to make use of handwritten, printed, or otherwise recorded matter. While the
penalty is at the discretion of the director, a forfeit loss is usually ruled if the material is relevant to the game, while
a lesser penalty or warning is common otherwise. For example, a player on move five of a King’s Indian Defense
would usually be forfeited for reading a book on the King’s Indian but given a warning or time penalty for reading
one on rook endings. See also 1C2, Director discretion and 21K, Use of director’s power.
TD TIP: Often players will use headphones to listen to material unrelated to the game. This is not a violation of
Rule 20B; however, a director may inspect the listening device(s) used to make sure that the material is indeed
unrelated to the game.
20C. Use of notes prohibited.
The use of notes made during the game as an aid to memory is forbidden, aside from the actual recording of the
moves, draw offers, and clock times, and the header information normally found on a scoresheet. This is a much less
serious offense than 20B; a warning or minor time penalty is common, with more severe punishment if the offense is
repeated. See also 1C2, Director discretion; 15, The Recording of Games; and 21K, Use of director’s power.
20D. Use of additional chessboard or computer prohibited.
A player who analyzes a game in progress on another chessboard or consults a computer about the position is guilty
of a serious violation of the rules. Though the director still has discretion, the usual penalty is loss of the game. See
also 1C2, Director discretion; 21K, Use of director’s power; and 36H, Consultation.
20E. Soliciting or using advice prohibited.
During play the players are forbidden to make use of any notes, sources of information or advice (solicited or not),
or analyze on another chessboard. See also 1C2, Director discretion; 20N, Electronic communication devices; and
21K, Use of director’s power.
20E1. Solicited advice.
This is a serious violation and a forfeit loss is often ruled. See also 1C2, Director discretion and 21K, Use of
director’s power.
TD TIP: The director has the right to require that cell phones and other communication devices be turned off in the
tournament room.
20E2. Unsolicited advice.
Ruling on unsolicited advice can be difficult. The giver deserves a penalty, but what of the recipient? The director’s
task is to prevent a player from benefiting from advice but also not unduly penalize the player for another’s offense.
There is sometimes no good solution to this problem, but here are a few examples of possible rulings. 
a. A Class D player suggests a winning move to a Master. If, as is likely, the director feels the Master
would probably find the move without recourse to the advice, no penalty should be imposed.
b. A Master suggests a winning move to a Class D player. If the director feels the D player would
probably not find the move without help, the ruling may be that the D player is prohibited from making
the move.
c. A move is suggested, and the director is not sure if it is a good one. The recipient seems to have other
acceptable moves. The ruling might be that the player must play a different move, as this seems least
likely to cause injustice.
d. A winning move is suggested. All other moves seem to lose and the director believes it unclear
whether the player would have likely found the move without help. This situation is especially
difficult. If the move is allowed, the opponent will feel cheated by the spectator. If it is not permitted,
the player will feel cheated, claiming he or she would have found it without help.
Neither ruling is incorrect, but perhaps fairer would be to rule the game a draw (see 14J) or to show the
position to several players of similar rating to the one involved, who are unaware of and have no stake
in the dispute, to help determine whether a player of that strength is likely to find the move.
e. A weak move is suggested. No need to penalize the recipient.
f. A player with five moves to make in ten minutes and an unclear position forgets to press the clock and
this is pointed out by a spectator 30 seconds later. The director may only guess whether the player
would have noticed the clock before the flag fell, and if so, how much time would have elapsed. A
time penalty of a few minutes might be appropriate.
g. The situation is identical to f above except that nine of the ten minutes have elapsed before the
spectator’s intervention. The director must consider that having not noticed for nine minutes, the player
may well not have pressed the clock in the last minute either. A forfeit is unfair as the player might
have noticed in the final minute, but not taking strong action may be even more unfair to the opponent.
Imposing a time penalty on a player already surprised to have only a minute left may be reasonable. It
is unclear whether the player would be helped or hurt by the spectator’s intervention and a subsequent
decision by the director to take away most of the last minute.
h. The situation is the same as g above except that the player who forgot to press the clock has an easy
win and will have no problem making the last five moves in a few seconds if necessary. To give the
player even a few seconds would mean defeat for an opponent who had good chances to win on time
before the spectator interfered.
Leaving any time for the negligent player would be unfair to the opponent, but ruling a time forfeit
would be unfair to the negligent player. The lesser of evils solution might be to declare the game a
draw in accordance with 14J.
i. In all such situations, if the unsolicited advice comes from a relative, close friend, teammate, or coach,
the director may impose a more severe penalty than otherwise and may consider the advice solicited.
j. In a team or individual/team event, if unsolicited advice is given by a teammate or coach, the director
has the option of forfeiting the game for team purposes but allowing it to continue for individual
purposes and US Chess rating, possibly with a further penalty.
See also 1C2, Director discretion; 11I, Spectators; 13CI, Only players may call flag; 14G2, Players apparently
unaware of situation; 16Y, Assisting players with time management prohibited; 20M5, Spectators cannot make
claims; 21D, Intervening in games; and 21K, Use of director’s power.
20F. Analysis in the playing room prohibited.
No analysis is permitted in the playing room during play or during adjourned sessions. See also 1C2, Director
discretion; 21F, Player requests for rulings; and 21K, Use of director’s power.
20F1. Adjournment help outside playing room allowed.
While a game is adjourned, a player may receive help outside the playing room from any source, including other
players, books, or computers. A prohibition on such help would be unenforceable and would penalize only those
honest enough to observe it.
20G. Annoying behavior prohibited.
It is forbidden to distract or annoy the opponent in any manner whatsoever. A director, upon a complaint by the
opponent, has discretion to determine whether any particular behavior is in violation of this rule and to impose
penalties. See also 1C2, Director discretion; 21F, Player requests for rulings; and 21K, Use of director’s power.
20G1. Inadvertent annoying behavior.
Sometimes a player’s actions, though annoying to the opponent and possibly others, are clearly unintentional. For
instance, a player may occasionally cough. While the director has the right to invoke rule 20G, this is quite harsh if
the player’s actions are involuntary. A partial solution is to assign such a player to a board in another room or far
away from other games.
TD TIP: What is annoying to one person is perfectly acceptable to another. That is why the director decides what is
and is not annoying. Uncommon and obtrusive activity is more likely to also be annoying activity. Often if a director
just makes players aware that their activity is annoying, the activity stops; however, if that and a warning do not
prevent the annoying activity, then stronger penalties can be imposed at the discretion of the director.
20H. Long absence during play.
Players with games in progress should not leave the playing room for more than 15 minutes without permission
from the director. A first offense usually does not warrant a forfeit unless there is additional evidence suggesting a
further rules violation during the absence. For further information see 18G1, Example of emergency.
20H1. Quitting without resigning.
It is rude and unsportsmanlike to abandon a lost position without resigning. Any player with a bad position who is
absent without permission for over 15 minutes risks having the game adjudicated. See also 18G1, Example of
emergency and 20H, Long absence during play.
20I. Discussion of games.
Players should not discuss their games in progress with anyone; this may lead to penalties under 20E, Soliciting or
using advice prohibited. The director has the option of banning all talking in the tournament room, even if not loud
enough to be disturbing. See also 1C2, Director discretion; 20K, Penalties; 21F2, Facts are agreed upon; and 21K,
Use of director’s power.
20J. Last round discussion.
Especially in the last round, it is improper for contenders paired against each other to engage in discussions about
the game or its outcome before or during the game. See also 1C2, Director discretion; 20K, Penalties; 21F, Player
requests for rulings; and 21K, Use of director’s power.
20K. Penalties.
Infractions of these rules may incur penalties, including time penalties, loss of the game, expulsion from the
tournament, or other penalties or combinations of penalties. See also 1C2, Director discretion; 13I, Refusal to obey
rules; 21F, Player requests for rulings; and 21K, Use of director’s power.
20L. Manipulating results.
Collusion to fix or throw games, whether before or during the game, in order to manipulate prize money, title norms,
ratings, or for any other purpose is illegal and may result in severe sanctions, including revocation of US Chess
membership. Such agreements include arrangements to split prize money no matter what the result of the game. See
also US Chess Code of Ethics.
20M. Behavior of spectators.
20M1. Spectators have no special privileges.
Spectators not playing in the tournament have no special privileges. For instance, if a player complains that a
particular spectator’s presence near his or her game is disturbing, rather than investigate the complaint to determine
its validity, it may be correct for the director to simply require the spectator to move away from that game. If more
complaints are received about the same person, the director may ask that spectator to leave the premises. If the
spectator has paid an admission fee, it may be appropriate to refund this fee.
If a player repeatedly complains about various spectators for no apparent reason, the director may choose to
disregard such complaints, informing the player that spectators are allowed at the tournament.
20M2. Spectator is player with game in progress.
If the offending spectator is a player in the tournament, especially one with a game in progress close to the
complaining player, the situation is less clear. More consideration should now be given to the merits of the
complaint, as it is reasonable for an entrant to expect to be able to watch nearby games while playing his or her own
game, and this may be impossible without provoking the complaint. But if in doubt, the director should still consider
the rights of players to be preeminent over those of spectators.
20M3. Ongoing problems.
Occasionally there may be an ongoing situation in which a player complains that another player’s presence is
disturbing, or each complains that the other is disturbing. One way to deal with this problem in future rounds is to
assign the players to special boards far away from each other or in different rooms. See also 1C2, Director
discretion; 21F, Player requests for rulings; and 21K, Use of director’s power.
20M4. Prohibitions.
It is highly improper, and warrants ejection from the premises, for any spectator to discuss a player’s position or
time management with that player, to point out that it is the player’s move, or to talk in a loud enough voice to be
heard by a player with a game in progress. See also 1C2, Director discretion; 21F, Player requests for rulings; and
21K, Use of director’s power.
20M5. Spectators cannot make claims.
Spectators, including parents and coaches, may point out irregularities to the director in a manner neither heard nor
noticed by the players, but have no right to make claims of any kind on behalf of players. If a problem arises during
play, a player of any age should understand that he or she should promptly stop both clocks and see a director. A
spectator who makes a claim may be ejected. See also 1C2, Director discretion; 11I, Spectators; 13C1, Only players
may call flag; 14G2, Players apparently unaware of situation; 16Y, Assisting players with time management
prohibited; 20E2, Unsolicited advice; and 21K, Use of director’s power.
20M6. Spectator visibility.
To minimize claims of illegal assistance, if a relative, close friend, or coach of a player is permitted to stand near
that player during play, that spectator should stand behind that player rather than in front, so the spectator is not
visible to the player. See also 1C2, Director discretion; 21F, Player requests for rulings; and 21K, Use of director’s
power.
20N. Electronic communication devices.
Players are not allowed to leave the playing venue without permission from the arbiter. The playing venue is defined
as the playing area, rest rooms, refreshment and smoking area, adjacent hallways and other places as designated by
the arbiter/TD.
Without the permission of the arbiter/TD a player is forbidden to have a mobile phone or other electronic means of
communication in the playing venue, unless they are completely switched off.
TD TIP: “Permission of the director” allows for maximum flexibility. No specific penalty is prescribed. In the
absence of announced rules for a specific event, the standard penalties apply (see 20N1). Organizers are free to
announce whatever penalty is appropriate for their event. This rule addresses possession of a communications
device. In practice, the device ringing or making some other sound may be the only practical way to detect a cell
phone—but this rule is not aimed at penalizing the noise; it is aimed at penalizing the possession of a
communications device.
20N1. Disturbing noise or disruption of games.
Audible disruptive noises such as a cell phone ring tone, pager beep, alarms and other noises cause a disruption in
the playing hall. These noises are often very loud and disturb the entire room. The following are guidelines for
penalizing such disturbances:
a. First offense standard penalty is to subtract 10 minutes or half the remaining time from a player’s clock,
whichever is less. Variant: Depending on the importance of the event the standard penalty may be up to
immediate loss of the game in progress. If a variant is used, it must be announced at the opening remarks
for the event and posted prominently in the playing hall and at all entrances.
b. Second (and subsequent) offense for the same player during the same event is loss of the game currently in
progress.
c. If the incident occurs in the playing hall, but after the offender’s game for the round is completed while
other games are still in progress, then the above penalties apply to the subsequent round. In the case of a
loss (e.g. second offense), that player is not paired for the next round.
d. If the incident occurs after the game for the last round is complete while other games are still in progress,
the offender is treated like a non-participating spectator and is ejected from the playing hall. Variant:
Depending on the importance of the event and the disturbance created, the player may receive a ½ point
total score penalty for prize distribution.
21. The Tournament Director
21A. The chief tournament director.
Responsible for all play, the tournament director must see that the rules are observed. The director is bound by the
official rules of chess, by US Chess tournament rules and code of ethics, and by all US Chess procedures and
policies.
21B. Duties and powers.
The chief tournament director‘s duties and powers normally include the following: to appoint assistants as required
to help in the performance of his or her duties; to accept and list entries; to provide suitable conditions of play; to
familiarize players with the playing facility and other tournament conditions; to prepare pairings; to display wall
charts; to rule on disputes and enforce such rulings; and to collect scores, report results, and forward US Chess and
membership applications, tournament results and fees to the sponsoring organization and for the official record. See
also 1C2, Director discretion; 21F, Player requests for rulings; and 21K, Use of director’s power.
21C. Delegation of duties.
The chief director may delegate any duties to assistants, but is not thereby relieved of responsibility for performance
of these duties.
21D. Intervening in games.
The director’s intervention in a chess game shall generally be limited to the following:
21D1. Answering rules questions.
Answering rules and procedural questions.
21D2. Correcting illegal moves observed.
Correcting any illegal moves observed, unless time pressure exists (11D1) or Variation 11H1 is
used (the director does not correct illegal moves unless asked by a player).
21D3. Warning players.
Warning players about or penalizing players for disruptive, unethical, or unsportsmanlike
behavior. See also 1C2, Director discretion; 13I, Refusal to obey rules; 21F, Player requests for
rulings; and 21K, Use of director’s power.
21D4. Settling disputes.
Settling disputes, including those regarding time forfeits and claims of draws.
21D5. Informing players.
Informing players about opponents’ late arrivals or about opponents’ leaving the room for an
extended period.
21D6. Fees.
Collecting fees.
See also 1C2, Director discretion; 11I, Spectators; 11J, Deliberate illegal moves; 13C1, Only players may call flag;
14G2, Players apparently unaware of situation; 14J, Draw declared by director; 16Y, Assisting players with time
management prohibited; 18G, Adjudications; 18G1, Example of emergency; 18G2, Director declares game over;
20E2, Unsolicited advice; 20M5, Spectators cannot make claims; 21F, Player requests for rulings; and 21K, Use of
director’s power.
21E. The playing director.
A tournament director must not only be absolutely objective, but must also be able to devote full attention to
directing duties; for this reason, a director, on principle, should not direct and play in the same tournament. In US
Chess National Events, the director cannot be a playing director.
However, in club events and others that do not involve substantial prizes, it is common practice for the director to
play. A director may also serve as a house player (28M1). Those who choose this double role should be especially
careful to maintain objectivity. If possible, a playing director should appoint another director to make rulings
involving his or her own games.
A playing director who must devote time to a dispute in another game may stop his or her own clock during this
period. While the clock is stopped, the director should not look at the position of his or her own game, but the
director’s opponent is permitted to do so.
21F. Player requests for rulings.
A player has the right to stop both clocks to ask the director to rule upon a point of law, procedure, or conduct. The
director must first establish the facts without disturbing other games. Extended discussions between director and
player(s) is inappropriate in the tournament room; a hallway or headquarters room is more desirable. See also 5I,
Stopping the clock; 13C6, Claimant’s clock; and 16Q, Interruption of game.
21F1. Timing of requests.
A player with a valid claim or complaint of any type should immediately stop both clocks (5I) and see a director. In
most cases, the player who defers such a claim waives the right to make the claim. However, a delayed claim may
still be in order if it is based on evidence not previously available, such as the testimony of a witness, or if the
situation causing the claim remains in existence. See also 13C6, Claimant’s clock and 16Q, Interruption of game.
21F2. Facts are agreed upon.
If the facts are agreed upon, the director should rule as follows:
a. If no penalty is prescribed by the rules and there is no occasion to exercise the director’s discretionary
power to penalize, the players should be directed to proceed with play.
b. If a case is clearly covered by a rule that specifies a penalty, the director should enforce that penalty.
See also 1C2, Director discretion; 13I, Refusal to obey rules; and 21K, Use of director’s power.
c. If an infraction has occurred for which no penalty is prescribed, the director’s discretionary power to
penalize may be exercised. See also 1C2, Director discretion; 1C2a, Standard penalty;13I, Refusal to
obey rules; and 21K, Use of director’s power.
21F3. Facts are not agreed upon.
If the facts are not agreed upon, the director should proceed as follows:
a. A director who is satisfied that the facts have been ascertained should rule accordingly.
b. A director who is unable to satisfactorily determine the facts must make a ruling that will permit play
to continue.
See also 1C2, Director discretion; 11I, Spectators; 11J, Deliberate illegal moves; 13C1, Only players may call
flag; 13I, Refusal to obey rules; 14G2, Players apparently unaware of situation; 14J, Draw declared by director;
16Y, Assisting players with time management prohibited; 18G2, Director declares game over; 20, Conduct of
players and spectators; 20E2, Unsolicited advice; 20M5, Spectators cannot make claims; 21D, Intervening in
games; 21F2, Facts are agreed upon; and 21K, Use of director’s power
21G. Evidence.
Unbiased evidence is required to support any claim by a player that the opponent violated a rule.
21H. Appeals.
A director who believes that an appeal of a ruling on a point of fact or the exercise of a discretionary power to
penalize might be in order should advise the player of the right to appeal.
21H1. How to appeal.
A player may appeal any ruling made by the chief director or an assistant director, provided that the appeal is made
within one-half hour and before the player resumes play, unless additional time is granted by the director. The
director may require that the appeal be made in writing. The appeals committee may penalize frivolous appeals. See
also 21I7, Groundless appeals.
21H2. Director may reserve decision.
The director may reserve a decision temporarily and direct that play continues before the appeal is heard. In this
case, the appellant must continue play under protest, that is, without prejudice to the appeal, regardless of the
outcome of further play. If the appellant wins that game, the appeal will be considered moot.
21H3. Response of chief director.
A chief tournament director who believes that the appeal is justified may reverse or modify any decision made by
the chief tournament director or another director. A chief director, who believes that the appeal has some merit, but
not enough to be upheld, should advise the appellant of the right to pursue the appeal further.
21H4. Appointment of committee or referee.
If a player notifies the director of intent to pursue the appeal further, the director shall appoint a committee (21I) or a
special referee (21J) to hear the appeal, unless the orderly progress of the tournament would be disturbed by such
action. If the director determines that either appointment would be disruptive, the player may reserve the right to
share in the prize fund by requesting to be paired for future rounds as if the appeal were upheld. The player has the
same right in the case of intending to appeal a local decision to US Chess.
21I. Appeals committee.
21I1. Composition.
An appeals committee should consist of at least three persons, preferably US Chess-certified tournament directors. A
committee of two is sufficient if both are certified at the senior director level or higher. Every attempt should be
made to appoint individuals to the appeals committee who have tournament director’s certification level equal to or
higher than that of the chief tournament director of the tournament. To ensure impartiality a special referee (21J) is
preferred over an appeals committee.
21I2. Procedure.
When a committee hears an appeal, all persons except committee members, the director, and both players shall be
excluded from the hearing. Witnesses may be called, but only to answer questions from the parties concerned, after
which they will be dismissed. The director shall furnish the committee with the current edition of the Official Rules
of Chess and shall call attention to the rules applicable to the dispute.
21I3. Witnesses.
The committee shall elicit the testimony of witnesses as it sees fit. In hearing the appeal, the committee must give
preeminent weight to the director’s testimony as to anything said or done in his or her presence.
21I4. Consultation.
The committee may consult a special referee (21J) by phone for advice, or may vote to refer the dispute to a special
referee.
21I5. Function of committee (standard of review).
The function of an appeals committee is not to substitute its judgment for that of the director, but rather to overrule
the director only if it is clear the latter’s ruling is incorrect. The committee should not overrule a proper decision
simply because it prefers an alternate proper decision.
21I6. Decision.
After hearing the testimony, the committee members shall deliberate among themselves to reach a decision, which
shall be put in writing, signed by all the members (even if one or more members voted against the decision), and
given to the chief director. In the event of a tie vote, the director’s decision shall stand.
21I7. Groundless appeals.
If the committee finds that the appeal is clearly groundless, it may penalize the player for that reason, or leave the
penalty to the director’s discretion. In ruling on an appeal, the committee may exercise all powers accorded to the
chief director by the rules and other US Chess procedures.
21J. The Special Referee.
A special referee is a director with substantial experience who is available to provide advice or make a ruling by
telephone. Phone numbers of special referees can be found currently on the US Chess web page using the
TD/Affiliate page and are also occasionally printed in Chess Life. To ensure impartiality a special referee is
preferred over an appeals committee (21I).
21J1. Usage.
The director may refer any appeal to a special referee, but should keep in mind that unless the facts are agreed upon,
or the players’ differences easily summarized, substantial delay and phone cost may result. Use of a special referee
is most appropriate when the tournament director is certified at a lower level than the referee, and when a director of
comparable certification to the referee is not immediately available to serve on an appeals committee.
21J2. Selection.
When selecting the referee to call, and the alternates to call if the original selection cannot be promptly reached, the
director should be sensitive to any reasonable objection by either player against the use of a particular referee.
21J3. The phone call.
When placing any call to the referee, the director should invite both players to be present. The director should not
inform the referee of the players’ names, but refer to them as White and Black.
21J4. Player contact with referee.
Neither player has an automatic right to speak to the referee. A director who finds such discussion unnecessary may
choose not to allow it. It is desirable that both players know in advance what the director will say and agree that it
will correctly reflect their viewpoints.
21J5. Validity of referee’s decision.
The decision of a special referee carries weight equal to that of an appeals committee. No decision of a special
referee may be appealed to an appeals committee, nor may any decision of an appeals committee be appealed to a
special referee. However, a special referee who believes the dispute can best be settled on-site may refer it to an
appeals committee, which then should be appointed.
21K. Use of director’s power.
21K1. Conciliation.
The director should make every effort to resolve a dispute by informal, conciliatory means before resorting to the
exercise of the director’s formal discretionary power to penalize. See also 1C2, Director discretion and 13I, Refusal
to obey rules.
21K2. Beware abuse of power.
Tournament directors should realize that the powers given to them under these rules should be used sparingly, to
restore equity or to penalize a serious infraction so as to discourage its recurrence. No one’s interests are served by
what appears to be the arbitrary or high-handed exercise of authority. See also 1C2, Director discretion and 13I,
Refusal to obey rules.
21L. Appeal to US Chess.
Any decision of an appeals committee or special referee, or of the director when an appeals committee or special
referee is not appointed, may be appealed to US Chess. See also 24B, Appeals to US Chess.
21L1. Procedure.
Appeals in writing must be postmarked within seven days of the end of the tournament to the US Chess office.
Appeals submitted after the seven-day deadline may be considered at the discretion of the committee hearing the
appeal. Appeals may be submitted via e-mail, but the business office or the committee(s) hearing the appeal may
require a signed statement. The office will refer an appeal to the appropriate committee(s) but may immediately
reject obviously groundless appeals. Most appeals will be referred to the Rules Committee, but some appeals may be
more appropriate for the Tournament Director Certification Committee or the Ethics Committee. A good-faith
deposit must be included with the appeal. The executive director shall from time to time review and set the required
deposit amount in consultation with those committees that handle appeals. The deposit will be returned unless the
ruling authority finds the appeal to be groundless and rules that the deposit is to be forfeited. US Chess reserves the
right to make final decisions concerning the rules and procedures that govern its competitions. See also 24A, Rules
Committee; and 24B, Appeals to US Chess.
TD TIP: In rare cases a committee(s) ruling is appealed to the US Chess Executive Board. Even more rare would
be an appeal of any US Chess Executive Board decision directly to the US Chess Delegates at the annual delegates
convention. In order for an appeal to be considered by the delegates many exact rules and regulations must be
followed. Contacting an experienced delegate would be advisable if an appeal to the delegates at the convention is
to be pursued.
22. Unplayed Games
22A. Games forfeited due to nonappearance.
A player who does not appear for the game, or appears too late, is given zero points and the opponent is given one
point. On pairing sheets (28J) and wall charts (28O), the forfeit is circled or indicated by an F. Computer wall charts
may use the symbol X for the winner and F for the loser of an unplayed game. See also 13D, Late arrival for game;
13F, Late arrival by both players; and 28P, Unplayed games.
22B. Full-point byes.
If there is an odd number of players for a round, and a suitable house player (28M1) not in the event cannot be found
to fill in, one player will receive a full-point (1) bye. See also 27A3, Upper half vs. lower half; 28A, Pairing cards or
program; 28J, The first round; 28K, Late entrants; 28L, Full-point byes; 28L4, Full-point byes after half-point byes;
28L5, New players in four-round event; 28M, Alternative to byes; 28S, Reentries; and 29C1, Upper half vs. lower
half.
22C. Half-point byes.
For the convenience of players, the director may allow half-point (0.5 or ½) byes for missed rounds. See also 27A3,
Upper half vs. lower half; 28A, Pairing cards or program; 28J, The first round; 28K, Late entrants; 28L, Full-point
byes; 28L4, Full-point byes after half-point byes; 28L5, New players in four-round event; 28L, Full point byes;
28M, Alternative to byes; 28S, Reentries; and 29C1, Upper half vs. lower half.
TD TIP: It is useful to have a bye signup sheet available until the announced cut off time for requesting byes ends.
Directors are urged to check this list before making any pairings.
22C1. Availability.
Half-point byes may be offered during the first half of a tournament or the middle round of a tournament with an
odd number of rounds, with or without advance notice. If pre-tournament publicity does not address this subject,
players may contact the organizer to inquire about availability.
If half-point byes are allowed for any rounds during the second half of a tournament, they should be mentioned in
pre-tournament publicity. An exception may be made in the event of emergency.

#### 22C2. Deadline for bye requests.

All requests for half-point byes should be made at least an hour before the bye round unless the director requires
otherwise.

#### 22C3. Byes and class prizes.

It is recommended that if class prizes are likely to be won with even or minus scores, half-point byes should be
unavailable or limited to one per player in such classes.

#### 22C4. Irrevocable byes.

If half-point byes are allowed for the final round, players must give irrevocable notice of such byes before beginning
their first game, or if the organizer so announces, their second game. The deadline for claiming such byes should
appear in pre-tournament publicity. It is recommended that other byes in the second half of the tournament be
treated similarly and that notice of all scheduled irrevocable byes be posted on or near the wall charts (28O).
TD TIP: It is useful for directors to note on bye signup sheets the latest time players can request last round byes.
Directors concerned about awarding unearned prize money need to be very careful in allowing players to sign up
for half-point byes in the last half of the tournament, especially the last round; therefore, it is common that those bye
requests be made well in advance of the start of the second half of the event, especially for the last round.

#### 22C5. Cancellation of irrevocable byes.

If the director agrees, a player may cancel an irrevocable half-point bye under the condition that if the player wins,
the result will be treated as a draw for prize purposes.

#### 22C6. Full-point byes after half-point byes.

A full-point bye should not be assigned to a player who has previously taken or committed to a half-point bye unless
all others in the score group have already had a bye or a no-show forfeit win. See also 28L, Full-point byes.
TD TIP: If a director is using a pairings program then it is wise to check the pairings after they have been made to
ensure that Rule 22C6 has been applied properly, especially in the case where a player has requested a bye in a
future round.

## 23. Organization and Membership

## 23A. Responsibilities of organizer.

Tournaments rated by US Chess must be organized by a US Chess affiliate or by US Chess itself. This organizer is
responsible for all financial matters related to the tournament and may select an individual or a committee to handle
the physical and financial arrangements. These include finding a playing site, setting a date and the times of the
rounds, determining the entry fees and prizes, hiring tournament directors, and advertising the event.
The organizing affiliate must select a chief tournament director (also referred to as director, TD, or arbiter) whose
US Chess certification level is appropriate for the type of tournament anticipated. The tournament director is
responsible for all decisions in the tournament regarding 
rules.
#### 23A1. Obligation to pay guaranteed prizes.

An affiliate that guarantees prize money but fails to pay it in full may have its US Chess affiliation revoked, and the
individual(s) responsible for that affiliate may be denied the right to affiliate under a different name. See also 32,
Prizes.
If extraordinary circumstances such as extreme weather conditions or civil unrest prevent most potential entrants
from playing in a tournament, the organizer may appeal to the US Chess executive director for permission to limit
the prizes to 100 percent of entry fees collected.

#### 23A2. Tournament cancellations.

Tournaments announced in Chess Life may be canceled only if one of the following conditions exists:
a. A timely cancellation notice appears in an appropriate issue of Chess Life.
b. Physical conditions, such as closure of site or extremely inclement weather, render the site unusable.
A disappointing number of advance entries is never a valid reason for cancellation. Organizers who cancel a
tournament in a non-emergency situation without proper notice will be prohibited from announcing tournaments in
Tournament Life or elsewhere in Chess Life for three years. (Additional penalties are also possible.)

#### 23A3. Advance entry refunds.

Unless otherwise stated in all advance publicity, advance entry fees are refundable to players who give notice of
withdrawal before the close of registration for round one.

#### 23A4. No refunds once event starts.

A player who begins play in the first round is not entitled to a refund of the entry fee or any portion of it, even if
forced to miss most games due to a medical or other emergency. Variations of this policy are at the discretion of the
organizer.

### 23B. Determination of game times.

The organizer determines game times unless the director makes or accepts other arrangements. See also Rule 17,
Scheduling.

### 23C. US Chess membership requirement.

For the inclusive dates of the tournament, each player must be a member in good standing of US Chess, unless US
Chess regulations waive this requirement.
TD TIP: This is a tricky task. Often players at registration say they have joined US Chess via various methods that
do not produce a receipt such as paying recently by check or credit card (on the phone or web). Sometimes they
have a receipt from an organizer or another TD that is unfamiliar to the person processing the registration. Some
directors decide on a case-by-case basis whether or not they are convinced of the validity of the renewal.
TD TIP: Some directors strictly enforce Rule 23C by making all players pay a US Chess membership fee if the
player’s membership cannot be verified with a membership card, in a hard copy or disk rating supplement, or online
at the US Chess website. This last approach may upset some players who have recently renewed but cannot verify
the renewal; however, the funds collected at registration for those US Chess memberships extend those
memberships for an extra year.
TD TIP: Another approach would be for the director to collect a membership fee from players whose memberships
are not verifiable and hold onto those funds in escrow until US Chess rates the tournament. If at that point the
director is notified by US Chess that those players are not members, then the director can pass along the
membership fees being held in escrow directly on to US Chess. A copy of the US Chess non-member notice can be
passed along to the players with their membership receipts. All other escrow US Chess membership fees should then
be returned to the players that US Chess did not identify to the director as non-members.

## 24. Interpretation of the Rules

### 24A. Rules Committee.

US Chess maintains a standing Rules Committee to review questions pertaining to the rules of play. In case of doubt
as to the application or interpretation of these rules, the US Chess Rules Committee will examine the case in point
and render an official decision.

### 24B. Appeals to US Chess.

All proper appeals made to the US Chess National Office shall be referred to the appropriate committee(s), which in
most cases is the Rules Committee. Occasionally appeals are more appropriate for other committees. A copy of any
appeal considered by the committee shall first be furnished to the chief tournament director plus any other
appropriate director(s) of the tournament involved, who should respond with a written statement of his or her own
position and any other pertinent documentation. Failure to respond may result in disciplinary action. A copy of the
decision(s) of the committee(s) shall be sent to all interested parties. See also 21L, Appeal to US Chess; 21L1,
Procedure; and Certification Restrictions (48, Restrictions; 49, Due Process; 50, Penalties; 51, Appeals; and 54,
Professional Misconduct).
