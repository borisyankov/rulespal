# Telestrations Rulebook

**WELCOME** to Telestrationsâ„¢, the visual version of the classic "telephone" game... where your sketches & guesses can create laugh-out- loud party fun! It's the game where you **DRAW** what you see, then **GUESS** what you saw!

## OBJECT

To laugh a lot and have fun with friends and family. Who knows, you might even discover the inner artist in you!

## SETUP

1. Place **card box**, **sand timer**, **clean-up cloths** & **die** in center of the group.

2. **Decide** as a group which cards everyone will be using, **"THIS SIDE"** or **"THAT SIDE"**.

3. Each player selects a **sketch book**, one **marker** & one **card**.

4. **Write your name** in the front of your sketch book and remember the color of your coil.

**NOW THE FUN CAN BEGIN!**

### CONTENTS:

* 142"This Side" & "That Side" Cards in Card Box (over 1,700 words)
* 8 Erasable Sketch Books
* 8 Dry-Erase Markers
* 8 Clean-Up Cloths
* 60 Second Timer
* 1 Die

## 1. GETTING A WORD

Select a player to roll the die to start the round. Match the number rolled to the word on your card. Secretly write it in your book.

Don't say it out loud or show it to anyone!

**NOTE:** If there is a blank space on your card that matches the number rolled, you get to make up any word(s) you want. If you see an underlined category, such as **"TV SHOW"**, you get to make up any word(s) in that category.

## 2. HOW MANY ARE PLAYING?

### EVEN: 4,6 OR 8

Turn to **"SKETCH IT"** page 1.  
Get ready to *secretly* draw your word.  
Now continue on to step 3.

### ODD: 5 OR 7

Turn to **"SKETCH IT"** page 1 and then ...  
**PASS BOOK TO PLAYER ON LEFT!**  
That player secretly looks at your word, then gets ready to draw it on **"SKETCH IT"** page 1.  
Now continue on to step 3.

## 3. SKETCHING

Everyone should now be on **"SKETCH IT"** page 1. Flip the timer. You have 60 seconds to secretly draw the word. When time's up, take a couple seconds to finish up. Don't leave it blank! Turn to page 2 to hide your sketch & pass open book to player on your left.

## 4. GUESSING

Now everyone should be on **"GUESS IT"** page 2. Flip back to the previous page & take a few seconds to secretly look at the sketch. Then return to page 2 to write your guess. Flip forward to next page & pass open book to player on your left.

## 5. ROUND & ROUND IT GOES

Flip the 60 second timer... everyone continues to sketch, pass & guess until players get their own book back. Note the color of your sketch book coil to ensure it is your book.

## 6. THE BIG REVEAL!

Now that everyone has their own book back, it's time for the Big Reveal! Take turns flipping through & sharing the **SKETCHING** & **GUESSING** outcomes in your book!

## HELPFUL HINTS:

### SKETCHING HINTS

No letters or numbers.  
Do your best to draw your word.  
Trust me, it will lead to the most fun!

### GUESSING HINTS

Don't just put a question mark or leave the page blank. Write any guess... no matter how silly it may seem.

### PASSING HINTS

When you're finished sketching or guessing, flip forward a page and wait until all players are ready. Everyone passes open books at the same time.

### ARE YOU A WINNER?

DID YOU HAVE FUN? WELL, THEN YOU'VE WON!  
WHAT ABOUT KEEPING SCORE? IF YOU'D LIKE TO DO SO, THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS IN THE "SCORING" SECTION LOCATED ON THE NEXT PAGE!

### WANNA PLAY AGAIN?

I DON'T BLAME YOU!
HERE'S WHATCHA DO ...

FIRST, EVERYONE ERASE PAGES 1 - 8.  
NEXT, RETURN USED CARDS TO THE CARD BOX & EVERYONE GETS A NEW CARD.  
TO MIX IT UP, REVERSE PASSING DIRECTION FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF FUN & LAUGHTER.

## SCORING

So you wanna keep score? Each player will use the score sheet in the front of their book to record their points during each reveal. A game is played in 3 rounds. After 3 rounds, total up your points. The player with the most points... well you know!

### FRIENDLY SCORING:

After you reveal the outcomes in your own book:

1. Give 1 point to the player with your favorite **SKETCH** in your book.
2. Give 1 point to the player with your favorite **GUESS** in your book.
3. Give *yourself* 1 point if the last guess matches the secret word.

### COMPETITIVE SCORING:

As you reveal the outcomes in your own book, everyone can score points:

1. **Guessers** earn 1 point if their guess matches the secret word or previous guess.
2. **Sketchers** earn 1 point if their sketch helps a guesser make a match.
3. Give **yourself** 1 point if the last guess matches your secret word.

### TWIST THINGS UP!

Here are some fun game play twists for next time:

1. Switch seats or remember to reverse passing direction.
2. Sketch with your less dominant hand.
3. Create your own cards with words themed to different categories such as TV shows, movies, famous people, cartoon characters, superheroes, food, animals, sports, family, the 80s (any decade) ... or customize words to your next event, like a family reunion, baby shower, bridal shower, block party, etc.

#### MARKER & BOOK CARE

Make sure all sketch book pages are completely erased and clean before storing back inside game box, as ink may stain the pages. Recap markers after use. If a marker dries out, use any dry-erase marker and keep on playing.

Dry-erase markers may stain fabrics and some surfaces. Protect play area before use. Avoid contact with carpet, clothing, walls and furniture. Keep away from eyes and skin.
