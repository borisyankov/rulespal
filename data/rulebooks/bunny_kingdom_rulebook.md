# Bunny Kingdom Rulebook

Bunny Kingdom is a game for 2 to 4 players, in which you are Rabbit Lords who are conquering a new world on behalf of the Bunny King.

You will need to get the best of what these lands have to offer. Explore the furthest corners, construct Cities, farm Resources to make your Fiefs prosper, and accumulate precious Golden Carrots. Don’t forget to satisfy the King by accomplishing Missions of the utmost discretion on behalf of His Majesty!

Every choice can bring you laurels of victory, but in the end, only the most valiant among you will be named “Big Ears” by the Bunny King. Will you be worthy?

## Overview and Goal of the Game

Bunny Kingdom is a drafting and placement game that plays over 4 Rounds.

During each Round, players will develop Fiefs, construct Cities, farm new Resources, and receive Parchments.

Choose your cards carefully to develop your strategy. Keep in mind the cards you pass on may help your opponents! At the end of each Round, you harvest Golden Carrots based on your Fiefs, their Strength, and their Wealth. Parchments will not be revealed until the end of Round 4, and will definitely disrupt what appeared to be set in stone!

After the final scoring, the player with the most Golden Carrots wins the game.

## Components

* 1 New World board with a Score Track
* 144 Rabbit figurines (36 per color)
* 39 City figurines
  * 27 Strength 1 Cities
  * 9 Strength 2 Cities
  * 3 Strength 3 Cities
* 24 Building tokens
  * 12 Farm tokens
  * 6 Sky Tower tokens (3 pairs of 2 tokens each)
  * 6 Camp tokens
* 182 Exploration cards
* 4 Player Aid cards

## The New World Board

This board represents the New World. It is made up of a grid of 10 x 10 spaces. Each space is a Territory that you can control and farm.

The **Score Track** lets you record the Golden Carrots collected by players at the end of each Round, as well as those gained through Parchment cards at the end of the game.

### Territory Coordinates

Each Territory can be identified by its coordinates and a terrain type. Each Territory is associated with a unique Territory card.

#### Territory Types

* **Sea** spaces produce Fish.
* **Forest** spaces produce Wood.
* **Field** spaces produce Carrots.
* **Plains** spaces do not produce any Resources.
* **Mountain** spaces do not produce any Resources. Strength 3 Cities can only be played on Mountains.
* **Lava Flows** block the connection between two Mountains.
* **Cities** on the New World board are neutral until a player takes control of them.

### Rabbit Figurines

These figurines represent your Rabbits and are used to identify which Territories you control. Keep yours in front of you.

***Note:** In a 3-player game, if you run out of Rabbits, you can use some from the color that is not being used.*

### City Figurines

Cities are Buildings. Cities come in 3 different Strengths:

* Cities with Strength 1 have one Tower.
* Cities with Strength 2 have two Towers.
* Cities with Strength 3 have three Towers.

### Tokens

Tokens are Buildings. There are 3 types:

#### Farms

Farm tokens allow you to produce Resources. There are three kinds:

* 3 Basic Farms, producing Wood, Fish, or Carrots;
* 2 Trading Posts, that can produce a different basic Resource each Round;
* 7 unique Luxury Resource Farms, which produce luxury Resources but can only be built on specific types of Territories.

#### Sky Towers

Sky Tower tokens come in pairs and let you connect two separate Fiefs.

#### Camps

Camp tokens let you control empty Territories.

## Exploration Cards

You will use these cards to develop your Fiefs and obtain precious Golden Carrots. There are 100 Territory cards (one corresponding to each Territory on the board), 42 Building cards (21 Cities, 12 Farms, 3 Sky Towers, and 6 Camps), 3 Provisions cards, and 37 Parchment cards.

### Territory Cards

**Each Territory card represents one space on the board**, with the coordinates shown in the top-left of the card and a reminder of the Territory’s color. These cards let you control spaces to create and enlarge your Fiefs. Territories come in several types:

* **Fields, Forests, and Seas** produce basic Resources.
* **Plains and Mountains** do not produce any Resources.
* Already-established **Cities** have a Strength of 1.

***Note:** Each player places the cards they play in their own discard pile next to them. You may examine the cards in any player’s discard pile at any time in case you need to verify placement.*

### Building Cards

**Building cards allow you to place Buildings** (either
tokens or Cities) on Territories you control to increase
their Size, Wealth, or Strength.

There are four types of Buildings:

* **Sky Towers** let you connect two Fiefs.

* **Farms** produce basic (white background) or luxury (black background) Resources. The icon shows which Resource it produces.

  **A Trading Post** is a Farm that produces your choice of one of the three basic Resources: Wood, Fish, or Carrots.
* **Strength 1, 2, and 3 Cities** let you construct the corresponding Cities.

* **Camps** let you control empty Territories.

### Parchment Cards

**Parchment cards are kept secret until the end of the game and give you Golden Carrots.** There are two kinds of Parchment cards:

* **Missions** are rewarded with Golden Carrots if you complete them.
* **Treasures** give Golden Carrots without any requirements.

### Provisions Cards

**Provisions cards let you draw more Exploration cards.**

## Set Up

1. **Place the New World board in the middle of the table. Place one Strength 1 City** on each City space on the board.
2. **Each player chooses a color, puts the 36 Rabbit figurines** of that color in front of them, and places one of their Rabbits on space 0 of the Score Track.
3. **Place the remaining Cities and tokens** next to the board.
4. **Shuffle all the Exploration cards to make a deck** and place it face-down next to the New World board.

## The Phases of a Round

### 1 - Exploration Phase

#### A- Draft Cards

**Look at the cards in your Hand and choose 2 that you will play.**

Put them face-down in front of you. Place the rest of your cards face-down in front of your neighbor (be careful not to mix them with the cards they chose to play!).

They will take them *after* the Play Cards Step.

During rounds 1 and 3: pass the cards to the player on your left.  
During rounds 2 and 4: pass the cards to the player on your right.

#### B- Play Cards

**Play the 2 cards you chose** in the first step.

* **If you play a *Parchment card*, place it face-down in front of you without revealing it.** You can look at your Parchment cards at any time. They will be revealed after the 4th Round (at the End of the Game).

***Note:** The number of Parchment cards you have is public information.*

* **If you play a *Territory card*, place one of your Rabbits on the Territory shown on your card (it will have the same coordinates).** You control this Territory from now on. Put the Territory card in your discard pile.

***Note:** If the Territory is already occupied by an opponent’s **Camp**, remove their Rabbit and the **Camp** token before placing your own Rabbit. Your opponent loses control of the Territory. If the Territory is occupied by one of your own **Camps**, remove the **Camp** token. This Territory can now hold a different Building.*

#### A Fief

A Fief is a group of connected Territories under one player’s control. Territories are connected if they meet on the sides (top, bottom, left, or right—*not diagonally*), unless they are separated by a Lava Flow.

* **If you play a *Building card*, place it face-up in front of you and put the City or token shown (Farm, Sky Tower, or Camp) on it.**

You can place your Buildings on the New World board during the Construction Phase. Buildings let you improve your Fiefs to make them more valuable. After placing a Building, discard the associated card.

* **When you play a *Provisions card*, immediately draw and play two cards from the deck.** Put your Provisions card in your discard pile.

**You can now look at the cards your neighbor passed to you** (if there are any). **Repeat these two steps** (Draft and Play) until all the hand cards have been played (for example, a total of five times in a 4-player game). **After the last cards are played, begin the Construction Phase.**

## Special Rules for 2 Player Games

* **Each round, both players take 10 cards into their hand and place 10 cards facedown in front of them** without looking at them. These cards are their **Reserves**.

### A- Draft Cards

Each time, **before choosing cards to play, draw 1 card** from your Reserve and add it to your Hand.

Then, **instead of choosing 2 cards to play, choose 1 card that you will play and 1 that you will discard** (face-down). Pass the other cards to your opponent face-down. The Play Cards Step plays normally.

### 2 - Construction Phase

**During this phase, you can place your Buildings on the New World board** by following the conditions below. Buildings increase the Strength, Wealth, or size of your Fiefs. **You are never required to place a Building.** You can leave them in front of you to place later.

* **You can only place your Buildings on Territories you control,** except for Camps which can only be placed on empty Territories.
* **You must respect any *Building Requirements*** of your Buildings Luxury Resource Farms and Strength 3 Cities can only be placed on certain types of Territories, as indicated by the symbol on the card and the background color of the token.
* **A Building cannot be moved** once it has been placed on the board.
* **There can never be more than one Building (City or token) on a Territory.**
* **If you place a Building on a Territory that already produces a basic Resource** it continues to produce that Resource in addition to the effect of the Building.

#### Effects of Buildings

* **Strength 1, 2, and 3 Cities increase the Strength** of your Fief by 1, 2, or 3 respectively.
* **Farms increase the Wealth** of your Fief.
* **Sky Towers connect two of your Territories** in different Fiefs as if they were adjacent. These Territories and any Territories that are connected to them are now part of the same Fief.
* **Camps let you take control of any empty Territory** (without a Rabbit or a Building) on the board.

  Each Camp **has a priority number** (shown on the card). If you want to place a Camp, you must announce its priority number without announcing which Territory you want to play it on. Any player who has a Camp with a lower priority number can interrupt you and play their Camp before you (starting with whoever has the lowest priority number). After they play their Camp (or pass), you can either play yours or pass and save your Camp for a future Round.

  When you play a Camp, place one of your Rabbits on it to show that you control that Camp.

  If an opponent plays a **Territory card** that corresponds to one of your Camps, remove the Camp and replace your Rabbit with one of your opponent’s. If you played this card, simply remove the Camp. You may play a new Building on this Territory from now on.

### 3 - Harvest Phase

**During this phase, players harvest Golden Carrots from all their Fiefs.**

***Remember:** A Fief is a Territory or group of connected Territories that you control. Territories are connected on their sides (not diagonally). All of the connected Territories in a Fief share their Resources and Cities.*

***Important:** A Fief only provides Golden Carrots if it has **at least** one City **and** one Resource.*

#### Calculate the Golden Carrots collected from a Fief

During each Harvest Phase, every one of your Fiefs gives you:

**Golden Carrots from a Fief = Strength x Wealth**

#### Determining the Strength of a Fief

**The Strength of a Fief is the total of all of the Towers in its Cities.**

A Strength 1 City has one Tower, a Strength 2 City has two, and a Strength 3 City has three.

#### Determining the Wealth of a Fief

**The Wealth of a Fief is equal to the number of different Resources** it produces.

* Move your Rabbit up on the Score Track **for each Golden Carrot gained.** If you pass 100 Golden Carrots, put a second Rabbit on the +100 space. If you pass 200 Golden Carrots, move the Rabbit to the +200 space.
* **If you have just finished the 4th Round,** it is the End of the Game. All players reveal their Parchment cards and it’s time for the final scoring!

Once the Harvest Phase is complete, **begin a new Round.** Deal 10 or 12 new cards to each player, depending on the number of players.

## Revealing Parchments and the End of the Game

At the end of the game, it’s time to reveal your Parchments! One at a time, each player reveals their cards and checks to see if they have fulfilled the requirements of their Missions.

Treasures automatically give Golden Carrot, while gaining Golden Carrot through Missions depends on your Territories, Fiefs, Buildings, or even other Parchment cards.

For every Golden Carrot you gain, move your Rabbit up on the Score Track.

**The player with the most Golden Carrots wins the game and the honorific title of “Big Ears” until the next game!**

In case of a tie, the tied players share the victory.

### Notes on the Missions

#### Scoring Resources

Several Missions refer to the Resources you produce (for example, the Carpenter gives 1 Golden Carrot for each Wood you produce). Unlike Fiefs, these cards actually count “all Resources,” even if two or more identical Resources are produced by the same Fief, and including any produced by Farms.

***Important:** At the end of the game, Trading Posts produce the same Resource they produced at the end of Round 4. You cannot choose one Resource while calculating a Fief’s Wealth during the last Round, then choose a different Resource to fulfill a Mission.*

***Reminder:** A Territory can produce 2 Resources - a basic one on the board and a second one if you played a Farm on it.*

#### Scoring Cities

Some Missions refer to the number of Cities you control. The Strength is not important: A Strength 1 or 2 City counts the same for this type of scoring.

#### Scoring Fiefs

Other Missions refer to the number of Fiefs you have, or the number of Territories that make up a Fief. You **cannot** choose to ignore **Sky Towers** or **Camps** for these Missions. Territories connected by Buildings still make a single Fief.

## Special Parchments

### PanPan the Barbarian

This card refers to **all** of a player’s Territories (Plains and Mountains) that produce no Resources and have no Cities, even if they are part of a Fief that includes Territories that do.

### Liberal/Socialist

You copy the entire card: If you copy a Treasure, it also gives you Bonuses if you have the Treasure Guardian and/or the Treasure Hunter Mission.

### Gloves

They give you 1 Golden Carrot if you only have one glove **or 4 Golden Carrots each** if you have both gloves (for a total of 8 Golden Carrots).

### Little Prince

If there is a tie between the Fiefs that give you the most Golden Carrots, harvest all but one of them again.
