# Res Arcana Perlae Imperii

## Table of Contents

> On a wild coast, a seafaring mage prepares to dive below to a magical pearl bed in search of a pearl of power. Meanwhile, a dragon tamer travels to Blood Isle to seek an ancient dragon.

Welcome to *Perlae Imperii*™ (pearls of power), the second Res Arcana® expansion. Perlae Imperii adds a new essence type - pearls - and extends the game to 13 victory points. New mages, magic items, monuments, places of power, and artifacts further expand the game.

Perlae Imperii can be played with just the base game or combined with Lux et Tenebrae™ the first Res Arcana expansion.

## Contents

* **2 Places of Power** (double-sided)
* **12 Artifact cards**
* **4 Mage cards**
* **4 Monument cards**
* **1 Magic item**
* **1 Reminder tile**
* **25 Pearl essences**

## Setup

Combine the expansion components with the base game components. Place the Pearls in the center of the essence tray. Give each player 1 Pearl (in addition to their other essences).

The number of Places of Power and monuments to use varies with the number of players (see below). All magic items are always available.

This expansion, either with or without the first Res Arcana expansion, *Lux et Tenebrae*, can support 5 players. Even with both expansions, we do not recommend playing with 6 players.

| 2-5 | Monuments | Places of Power |
|:---:|:---------:|:---------------:|
|  2  |     7     |        4        |
|  3  |    10     |        5        |
|  4  |    12     |        6        |
|  5  |    14     |        7        |

Shuffle all the monuments together. Deal the number shown above to form the initial deck and return any unused monuments to the box (without examining them). Then draw 2 monuments and place them face up in the center.

Shuffle the Places of Power together, unseen below the table, and set out the number shown above, randomly choosing which side of each one to use. Return any unused places of power to the box.

After doing this, place the reminder tile Pearl side up in the center.

Perform the rest of setup normally.

***Note:** the 2-player game is now “tighter” and the 4-player game is now “looser” than with the base game rules. We strongly recommend using these rules for the best play experience.*

## Play

Play proceeds normally except as noted below:

The game now ends on a victory check when any player has 13 or more victory points (instead of 10 or more).

**Pearls.** These are a new essence type. Powers that produce essences of any type that exclude Gold cannot produce Pearls. Similarly, discounts that do not apply to Gold also do not apply to Pearls.

On a player's turn, a player may convert one or more Pearls in their essence pool each to gain 1 Gold essence or any 2 non-Gold, non-Pearl essences (which may be the same or different).

A player may also convert Pearls in their essence pool out of turn when using a React power or when responding to a React power condition (such as being attacked by a Dragon). If a timing conflict arises (when one player's decision on converting a Pearl depends on whether another player is doing so), resolve it clockwise, starting with the player with the First Player token.

During a victory check, each Pearl that a player has at the end of it, either on their components or in their essence pool, counts as 1 VP. Thus, each Pearl on the Pearl Bed is worth 3 VPs (2 for the Pearl Bed plus 1 for itself). As Pearls are worth victory points, they do not count towards breaking ties.

These rules are summarized on the front of the Reminder tile (its back has the setup chart).

***Note:** the demon artifact type (see Ghost Ship and Catherine Wheel) was introduced in Lux et Tenebrae. Some components have or interact (Illusionist) with it (to ensure that Lux et Tenebrae scales well with this expansion).*

## Component

### Fine Points

#### Mages

**Illusionist:** both her powers are React powers used to satisfy turning a Creature, Demon, or Dragon to pay a power cost; or when you use a Check Victory power and have a Place of Power that earns VPs for having Creatures, Demons, or Dragons in play. As Mages cannot be destroyed, her first power cannot be used with the *Lux et Tenebrae* Gate of Hell's second power.

#### Artifacts

**Catherine Wheel:** this inflicts life loss on all players (not rivals), including its owner.

**Raven Familiar:** you gain a Gold when you take it from the supply, placing it either in your essence pool or on a component. This can occur due to a power, Collect ability, the Discard an Artifact action, or by converting a pearl. Taking a Gold from a component (either during the Collect step or by using the *Lux et Tenebrae* Infernal Engine's second power) or putting a Gold from your essence pool onto a component (such as with the Mermaid or Infuser) does not gain a Gold.

**Phoenix:** for space reasons, the term "Destroy" has been merged into its power's cost icon.

**Scrimshaw Awl:** its first power's discount can be used to reduce Gold costs.

#### Places of Power

**Mystical Menagerie:** to use its second power, you must have cards in your deck. If your discard pile, but not your deck, has cards, then you can't pay its cost to use it and do not shuffle your discard pile to form a new deck.

## F.A.Q

**Q:** When a power’s cost involves discarding an artifact from your hand, do you also gain 1 Gold or 2 other essences from it?  
**A:** No (this gain occurs only when doing the discard action).

**Q:** When a power’s cost involves turning a different artifact, do you also activate that artifact’s power(s)?  
**A:** No (you are doing the “use a power” action; turning a different artifact is simply part of paying the power’s cost and has no other effects).  

**Q:** Can you use a power that adds an essence to a component to put an essence on a turned component (such as using the Mermaid to add a Gold to the Cursed Forge when it is turned)?  
**A:** Yes.

**Q:** Can powers that draw and put back cards be used on other players’ decks?  
**A:** No.

**Q:** Must essences used to pay for components and power costs come from your essence pool?  
**A:** Yes (unless otherwise indicated, e.g. Athanor’s Elan for its second power).

**Q:** On my turn, can I use a power that will produce no effect (to avoid having to pass)?  
**A:** Yes, provided you fully pay the power’s cost.

**Q:** Can powers that react to a victory check (i.e. Golden Statue or Dark Cathedral) react to either a check that occurs in the middle of the action step (such as one produced by Coral Castle) or one which occurs at the end of a round?  
**A:** Yes.
