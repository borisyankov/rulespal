## Setting up the game

If this is the first time you play, punch out all the pieces from the game's punchboards. Sort them and place them in the wells designed for each type of piece. Some types fit in the removable storage tray that came with your game. Other components fit inside their respective wells in the main vacuum tray of the game box. Refer to the illustration in Appendix I for more details on how to organize your tokens.

* Pick the **Small World** map that matches your number of players as indicated by the symbol next to the Game Turn track and place it in the center of the table.
* Place the Game Turn marker on the first spot of the map's Game Turn track. The track is used to monitor the game's progress. The game ends at the end of the turn in which the Game Turn marker reaches the last position on the track (8th, 9th or 10th turn, depending on the map played).
* Pull the removable storage tray with all of its Race tokens out of the box and place it open next to the board map within easy reach of all players.
* Shuffle all the Race banners; draw five at random and lay them face up (i.e. colored side visible) in a single column. Place the remaining banners face up, in a single stack, at the bottom of the column. Do the same with the Special Power badges, shuffling them and placing one to the left of each Race banner, its round edge fitting snuggly into the banner's round opening. Stack the rest of the badges in a pile to the left of the Race banners stack. You should now have a total of 6 Race banner and Special Power badge combos visible face up on the table, including the one on top of the stacks.
* Place a Lost Tribe token on each Region of the map featuring a Lost Tribe symbol. The Lost Tribes are remnants of long-forgotten civilizations that have fallen into decline but still populate some Regions at game start.
* Put a Mountain token on each Region of the map featuring a Mountain.
* Give each player five "1" Victory coins. Place all remaining coins, including all "3"s, "5"s and "10"s, in a Victory stash next to the board, within easy reach of all players. These coins will serve as your currency during the game, and help determine the winner at the end.

## Object of the game

Space is getting tight in **Small World**. There are just too many races living off your land - land your ancestors bequeathed to you in hopes you would build an empire with which you could dominate the world.

Picking a fantasy Race and Special Power combination, you must use their unique racial traits and skills to conquer surrounding Regions and amass Victory coins - often at the expense of weaker neighbors. Placing troops (Race tokens) in various Regions, and conquering adjacent lands, you earn Victory coins for each Region you occupy at the end of your turn. Eventually, your race will become increasingly over-extended (like those you have already crushed!) and you will need to abandon your civilization and look for another. The key to your victory is knowing when to push your empire into decline and ride a new one to supremacy in the land of **Small World**!

## Starting the game

The player whose ears are the most pointed starts the game, and takes his first turn. The game then proceeds clockwise, from player to player. Once all players have had a turn, a new turn begins.

The First Player moves the Game Turn marker forward one spot on the Game Turn Track, and proceeds with his next turn, followed by the others.

When the Game Turn marker reaches the last spot on the Game Turn Track, one final turn is played by all and the game ends. The player who has amassed the most Victory coins is declared the winner of the game.

### I. The first turn

During the First Turn of the game, each player:

1. Picks a Race and Special Power combo
2. Conquers some Regions
3. Scores some Victory coins

#### 1. Picking a Race and Special Power Combo

The player selects one Race and Special Power combo, from among the six that are visible on the table (including the combo made of the Race banner and Special Power badge sitting on top of the stacks at the bottom of the column).

The cost of each combo is determined by its position in the column. The first combo - located at the top of the column - is free. Each of the other combos, as you move in succession down the column, costs one additional Victory coin. That cost is paid by the player dropping one of his Victory coins on each of the combos situated above the combo he wishes to pick.

If the combo a player selects contains some Victory coins (dropped by players who previously passed up this combo), the player pockets these coins; he must still drop one of his own Victory coins on each of the combos located above the one he selected, however.

The player places his combo selection face up in front of him, and picks a number of matching Race tokens in the removable storage tray equal to the sum of the values indicated on the Race banner and its associated Special Power badge.

Unless stated otherwise (for example, Skeletons or Sorcerers) these Race tokens are the only ones the player will be able to deploy for this race during the course of the game.

If, on the other hand, a Special Power (or Race power) lets you take additional Race tokens from the storage tray during the course of the game, you are still limited by the total number of tokens physically available. So a player with 18 Sorcerer tokens on the board won't be able to use his Sorcerer power again until some of his tokens become available.

Finally, the player replenishes the column of combos available to others; this is achieved by sliding existing combos (and the Victory coins sitting on them, if any) up one position in the column, so as to fill the void, and revealing a new combo from the top of the stack, if appropriate. There should thus always be 6 combos visible to all players, on the table (within the limit of Race banners and Special Power badges available in the pile, once reshuffled if need be, of course).

#### 2. Conquering Regions

The player's Race tokens are used to conquer Regions of the map, whose occupation will yield Victory coins for that player.

##### First Conquest

A player's race deploying on the map for the first time must enter it by conquering one of its **border** Regions (i.e. a Region adjacent to the edge of the board or one whose shore is on a Sea adjacent to the edge of the board, even if the Sea is occupied by a Seafaring Race).

##### Conquering a Region

To conquer a Region, a player must have available to deploy: 2 Race tokens + 1 additional Race token for each Encampment, Fortress, Mountain, or Troll's Lair marker + 1 additional Race token for each Lost Tribe or other player's Race token already present in the Region. Seas and Lakes cannot usually be conquered.

Upon conquering a Region, the player must deploy the Race tokens he used to conquer this Region inside its borders on the map. These tokens must remain in this Region until the player reorganizes his troops at the end of this turn *(see [Troop Redeployment](#troop-redeployment))*.

***Important Note:** Regardless of a Race and/or Special Power benefit, a player must always have at least one Race token available to initiate a new Conquest.*

##### Enemy Losses & Withdrawals

If Race tokens of another player occupied the Region prior to its conquest, that player must immediately take all of these Race tokens back in hand and:

* Permanently discard one Race token back into the Storage tray;
* Keep the other Race tokens in hand, and redeploy them in any other Region(s) still occupied by his race (if any) as the final action of the current player's turn.

The Region(s) in which the remaining Race tokens, if any, redeploy do not have to be adjacent or contiguous to the Region(s) they fled from. If all of a player's Regions were attacked this turn, leaving him with some Race tokens in hand but none on the board, he may redeploy these as if he was doing a First Conquest, on his next turn.

When a Region defended by a single token is captured, the defending token is discarded. This will usually be the case if the defending token is a Lost Tribe or when the defending token belongs to a Race In Decline *(see [Entering into Decline](#entering-in-decline))*.

***Note:** A player may choose to conquer a Region occupied by his own In Decline token, if he wishes to: He will lose that token, but might gain access to a Region that is more profitable for his new Active Race tokens to occupy.*

Mountains are immovable, and remain in place to provide defense for their new conqueror.

##### Following Conquests

The active player can repeat this process to conquer as many new Regions as he wishes during his turn, provided he has enough Race tokens left to accomplish these successive conquests.

Each of the newly conquered Regions **must be adjacent** to (i.e. sharing a border with) a Region already occupied by his active Race tokens, unless permitted otherwise by his Race and Special Power combo.

##### Final Conquest Attempt/Reinforcement Die Roll

During the **final** conquest attempt of his turn, a player may find himself with not enough Race tokens left to conquer another Region outright. **Provided he still has at least one unused Race token,** the player may attempt one final conquest for his turn by selecting a Region that he would normally be 3 or less Race tokens short to conquer. Once the Region is selected, the player rolls the Reinforcement Die once. Note that the Region the player wishes to make his last conquest target for the turn must be selected **before** rolling the die. This Region does not have to be the weakest one available for attack either, provided it could still be conquered with a lucky die roll.

If the sum of the die rolled, combined with the Race token(s) left in his possession, is high enough to conquer the Region, the player deploys his remaining Race token(s) there. Otherwise, he deploys his remaining token(s) in one of the Regions he already occupied prior. Either way, his conquests for the turn end immediately thereafter.

##### Troop Redeployment

Once a player's conquests for the turn have ended, he may freely redeploy the Race tokens he has on the board, moving them from one Region to any other Region occupied by his race (not necessarily just an adjacent or contiguous Region), provided that **at least** one Race token remains in each Region under his control.

#### 3. Scoring Victory Coins

His turn now complete, the player receives 1 coin from the Victory stash for each Region his Race tokens occupy on the map. The player may also collect additional Victory coins as a result of his Race and/or Special Power benefit.

As the game progresses, a player will likely have some tokens from another race on the map. These tokens are the remnants of an earlier race he chose to put In Decline previously *(see [Entering into Decline](#entering-in-decline))*.

The Regions these In Decline tokens occupy also each contribute 1 Victory coin to the player; Though the Race banner and Special Power benefits no longer contribute any bonus coins, unless explicitly stated otherwise in said Race or Special Power benefit.

Players keep their Victory coins stacked together, their value **hidden** from other players at all times; final scores are not revealed until the end of the game. If necessary, a player may request change from the Victory stash for his coins at any time.

### II. Following turns

In following turns, the first player moves the Game Turn marker up one spot on the track and the game continues clockwise. During his turn, each player must now either:

* **Expand the reach of his race through new conquests**

**OR**

* **Put his race In Decline to select a new one.**

The player then scores Victory coins again *(see [Scoring Victory coins](#3-scoring-victory-coins))*.

#### Expanding through new Conquests

##### Ready your Troops

Leaving in place one Race token in each Region they occupy, the player may take all his other Active Race tokens from the map back in hand and use them to conquer new Regions.

##### Conquer

All rules relative to the conquest of a new Region *(see [Conquering Regions](#2-conquering-regions))* must be respected, with the exception of the rule relative to the First Conquest - which only applies to new races entering on the map.

##### Abandoning a Region

Only those Race tokens that were taken back in hand may
be used to conquer new Regions. If a player wishes to free up
some more Race tokens, he may opt to entirely empty up
some - or all - Regions, leaving no Tokens there; but in this
case, these now abandoned Regions will no longer be
considered his, nor bring him any Victory coins. If the player
chooses to abandon all the Regions he previously occupied,
his next conquest must follow the same rules as its First
Conquest *(see [First Conquest](#first-conquest))*.

#### Entering In Decline

Once a player thinks that his Active race is overextended and no longer has the impetus required to continue expanding successfully or defend itself from increasingly threatening neighbors, he may choose to put it In Decline by selecting a new Race and Special Power combo from those available on the table at the start of his next turn.

To do so, the player flips his current Race banner upside down, so that the grayed-out In Decline side becomes visible to all, and discards the Special Power badge that was associated with it as that Special Power badge is no longer in effect, unless dictated otherwise (e.g. Spirit Special Power).

He also flips a single Race token onto its In Decline side in each Region those tokens occupied and removes all other tokens of this Race from the map, placing them back into the storage tray.

Each player can only have a single race In Decline on the map at any given time. If the player still has tokens from an earlier In Decline race left on the map, those are all immediately removed from the map and placed back in the storage tray, before flipping the new tokens into Decline.

The Race banner of the now vanished race is placed at the bottom of the stack of Race banners, or in the lowest empty slot in the banner column, if any. The same is also done when the last token of a race In Decline is wiped off the map as the result of their last Region being conquered.

The player can make no conquests during the turn his race goes into decline; his turn ends immediately after scoring! He gains 1 Victory coin for each Region his newly In Decline tokens occupy, but unless stated otherwise, he scores no Victory coins from his now In Decline Race banner power or discarded Special Power benefits.

On his next turn, the player will select a new Race and Special Power combo from among those now available to him. He then follows the same rules used during the first turn of the game. The only difference, but it's a sizeable one, is that the player will now likely collect Victory coins from his new race as well as from left-over tokens of his now In Decline race, during the Scoring Victory coins phase of his turn.

In the unlikely event there are not enough Special Power badges left in the Special Powers stack to keep putting new Race and Special Power combos on the table, shuffle previously discarded Special Power badges into a new stack.

## End of the game

Once the Game Turn marker has reached its final spot on the Game Turn track and all players have had a chance to play a final turn, the Victory coins held by each player are revealed and tallied. The player with the highest score wins. In the case of a tie, the player with the most Race tokens (Active + In Decline) still on the board is the winner.

## Appendices

### I. Organize the Storage Tray

Because the *Small World* box contains many punchboards, once you have punched out all the tokens and coins, you will be left with a big gap between the top of the vacuum tray on which your boards sit and the cover of the box. If you like to store your games in an upright position, this void will likely cause the boards and all the tokens stored below it to move around and become jumbled.

To avoid this, we recommend the following one-time operation: Once all pieces have been punched out from the punchboards, take the left-over, now empty punchboard frames and rather than throw them away, stack them back up on the table. Carefully pull the vacuum tray insert that sits at the bottom of your game box and extract it, being careful not to break the thin plastic. Now place the stacked punchboard frames at the bottom of your game box and place the vacuum tray back in place inside the box so that it now sits on top of these. It is now raised by the right amount so that once boards are placed back on top they sit flush with the box cover. You are now ready to store your game box vertically, without having to worry about the game components shifting around.

The extractable storage tray is used solely for storing Race tokens, with a compartment dedicated for each race. The size of some of the wells in this tray has been standardized to facilitate the placement of the various Race tokens. All other coins, tokens and markers go in their designated spot, inside the main vacuum tray of the game box. The boards, summary sheets and rules go on top.

### II. The Races and Special

There are 14 Races and 20 Special Powers in *Small World*.

Each Race has its own distinctive Race banner, and tokens in sufficient number to deploy with any Special Power badge.

Each Special Power badge gives a unique benefit to the race it is associated with.

The Race tokens are placed on the map colored side face up when the race is Active, and colored side face down once the race is In Decline.

Unless stated otherwise, the benefits granted by an Active Race banner and its associated Special Power badge always cumulate, and no longer apply once the race is put In Decline.

A Region is deemed **non-empty** if, and only if, it contains at least one Lost Tribe or Race token (Active or In Decline). A Region that contains a Mountain marker but no Lost Tribe or enemy Race token is considered empty.

#### The Races

The list that follows details the benefit(s) conferred to each race; the number of matching Race tokens received when selecting this Race banner is indicated by the numerical value listed on the banner.

##### Amazons

Four of your Amazon tokens may only be used for conquest, not for defense, as indicated by the +4 on the banner itself. So you start your initial turn with 10 Amazon tokens (plus any additional ones that may be granted to you by the Special Power associated with the Amazons, depending on your combo). At the end of each of your Troop Redeployments *(see [Troop Redeployment](#troop-redeployment))*, remove four tokens from the map, making sure to leave at least one Amazon token in each of your Regions if possible, and only take these four tokens back in hand to redeploy on the map once you Ready your Troops *(see [Ready your Troops](#ready-your-troops))* at the start of your next turn.

##### Dwarves

Each Mine Region your Dwarves occupy is worth 1 bonus Victory coin, at the end of your turn. This power is kept even when the Dwarves are In Decline.

##### Elves

When the enemy conquers one of your Regions, keep all your Elf tokens in hand for redeployment at the end of the current player's turn, rather than discarding 1 Elf token back into the storage tray *(see [Enemy Losses & Withdrawals](#enemy-losses--withdrawals))*.

##### Ghouls

Your Ghoul tokens **all** stay on the map when going into Decline, instead of the usual 1 token per Region. In addition, unlike other Races, once In Decline, your Ghouls can continue to conquer new Regions in the following turns, playing exactly as if they were still Active tokens. However these conquests must be done at the start of your turn, before any conquest by your Active race. You may even attack your own currently Active race with your In Decline Ghouls, if you wish.

##### Giants

Your Giants may conquer any Region adjacent to a Mountain Region they occupy at a cost of 1 less Giant token than normal. A minimum of 1 Giant token is still required.

##### Halflings

Your Halfling tokens may enter the map through any Region of the map, not just border ones. Place a Hole-in-the-Ground in each of the first 2 Regions you conquer, to make them immune to enemy conquests as well as racial and special powers. You remove your Holes-in-the-Ground (and lose the protection they confer in these Regions) when your Halflings go into Decline, or if you choose to abandon a Region containing a Hole-in-the-Ground.

##### Humans

Each Farmland Region your Humans occupy is worth 1 bonus Victory coin, at the end of your turn.

##### Orcs

Each not empty Region your Orcs conquered this turn is worth 1 bonus Victory coin, at the end of your turn.

##### Ratmen

No Race benefit; their sheer number of tokens is enough!

##### Skeletons

During your [Troop Redeployment](#troop-redeployment), take 1 new Skeleton token from the storage tray for every 2 non-empty Regions you conquered this turn, and add it to the troops you redeploy at the end of your turn. If there are no more tokens in the storage tray, you do not receive any additional tokens.

##### Sorcerers

Once per turn per opponent, your Sorcerers can conquer a Region by substituting one of your opponent's **Active** tokens with one of your own taken from the storage tray. If there are no more tokens in the storage tray, then you cannot conquer a new Region in this way. The token your Sorcerers replaces must be the only race token in its Region (A single Troll token with its Troll's Lair is considered alone for this purpose; likewise for a Race token in a Fortress or on a Mountain, these markers provide no protection to a lone Race token) and that Region must be adjacent to one of your Sorcerers'. Place the substituted opponent's Race token back into the storage tray. If an Elf is converted by a Sorcerer, the Elf does lose his token.

##### Tritons

Your Tritons may conquer all Coastal Regions (those bordering a Sea or Lake) at a cost of 1 less Triton token than normal. A minimum of 1 Triton token is still required.

##### Trolls

Place a Troll's Lair in each Region your Trolls occupy. The Troll's Lair augments your region's defense by 1 (just as if you had an additional Troll token stationed there), and stays in the Region even after your Trolls go into Decline. Remove the Troll's Lair if you abandon the Region or when an enemy conquers it.

##### Wizards

Each Magic Region your Wizards occupy is worth 1 bonus Victory coin, at the end of your turn.

##### Blank Race banner

We have provided you with one additional blank Race banner, which you may use to create a race of your own invention. When designing such a race and choosing the number of Race tokens to assign to it, keep in mind that it may end up associated with any possible Special Power. Make sure never to pick a number higher than 10 or you will risk running out of Race tokens you might otherwise have been entitled to during the course of the game.

If you wish to play with your newly created race, use the tokens of another race (with a similar or greater number of tokens) as stand-in tokens for your new race - and make sure to remove the corresponding old Race banner from the game before the start!

#### Special Powers

In the description of Special Powers that follow, when we use the term "you" or "your", we mean the Race tokens of your race associated with this Special Power. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this usually excludes any token In Decline from your earlier race.

The list that follows details the advantage(s) granted by this Special Power; the additional number of Race tokens received when associating this Special Power to a Race banner is listed in the circle inside the Special Power badge.

##### Alchemist

Collect 2 bonus Victory coins at the end of each turn your race hasn't yet gone into Decline.

##### Berserk

You may use the Reinforcement die before each of your conquests, rather than just the last one of your turn. Roll the die first; select the Region you wish to conquer; then place the required number of Race tokens (minus the die results) there. If you do not have enough tokens left, this is your final conquest attempt for the turn. As usual, a minimum of 1 token is still required to attempt the conquest.

##### Bivouacking

Deploy the 5 Encampment tokens in any of your Region(s), during your Troop Redeployment phase. Each Encampment counts as 1 Race token toward the defense of the Region in which it is placed (thereby protecting a single Race token with an Encampment from the Sorcerer's Racial Power). Multiple Encampments may be placed in the same Region to obtain a higher defense bonus. Each turn you may break camp and settle in any new Region you occupy. Encampments are never lost during an attack on the Region they are in: they are redeployed at the end of the current player's turn. When the Race they were associated with goes into Decline, they disappear.

##### Commando

You may conquer any Region with 1 less Race token than normal. A minimum of 1 token is still required.

##### Diplomat

At the end of your turn, you may select one opponent whose Active race you did not attack this turn as your ally. You are now at peace with him and he cannot attack your active race until your next turn. You may change allies each turn, or stay at peace with the same opponent. Tokens In Decline are not impacted (so Ghouls In Decline are immune to this power and may still attack you).

##### Dragon Master

Once per turn, you may conquer a Region using a single Race token, regardless of the number of enemy tokens defending it. Once conquered, place your Dragon there. The Region is now immune to enemy conquests as well as to their racial and special powers until your Dragon moves. During each new turn, you may move your Dragon to a different Region you wish to conquer. Your Dragon disappears when you go into Decline; remove it from the board and place it back in the storage tray at that time.

##### Flying

You may conquer any Region of the map except Seas and Lakes. These Regions do not need to be adjacent or contiguous to ones you already occupy.

##### Forest

Collect 1 bonus Victory coin for each Forest Region you occupy at turn's end.

##### Fortified

Once per turn, as long as your Fortified Race is active, you may place 1 Fortress in a Region you occupy. The Fortress is worth 1 bonus Victory coin at turn's end, unless you are In Decline. The Fortress also augments your Region's defense by 1 (just as if you had an additional Race token stationed there), even if you are In Decline. Remove the Fortress if you abandon the Region or when an enemy conquers it. There can only ever be a maximum of 1 Fortress per Region, and a maximum of 6 Fortresses on the map.

##### Heroic

At the end of your turn, place each of your 2 Heroes in 2 different Regions you occupy. These 2 Regions are immune to enemy conquests as well as to their racial and special powers until your Heroes move. Your Heroes disappear when you go into Decline.

##### Hill

Collect 1 bonus Victory coin for each Hill Region you occupy at turn's end.

##### Merchant

Collect 1 bonus Victory coin for any Region you occupy at turn's end.

##### Mounted

You may conquer any Hill or Farmland Region with 1 less Race token than normal. A minimum of 1 token is still required.

##### Pillaging

Each non-empty Region you conquer this turn is worth 1 bonus Victory coin at turn's end.

##### Seafaring

As long as your Seafaring race is active, you may conquer the Seas and the Lake, considering them as 3 empty Regions. You keep these Regions even once you go into Decline, and continue scoring for them for as long as you have tokens there. Only Seafaring races may occupy the Seas and the Lake.

##### Spirit

When the Race tokens associated with your Spirit Special Power go into Decline, they never count toward the limit stated in [Entering In Decline](#entering-in-decline) regarding having a single In Decline race on the map at any given time. You may thus end up with two different races In Decline on the map at the same time and score for them both. If a third race you control goes into Decline, your Spirits remain on the board, although the other race already In Decline disappears, as normal. In other words, your In Decline Spirits never leave the map (except when taking losses from opponents' conquests), though other races sent In Decline may go away when a new race goes into decline.

##### Stout

You may go In Decline at the end of a regular turn of conquests, after scoring, instead of spending an entire turn going into Decline.

##### Swamp

Collect 1 bonus Victory coin for each Swamp Region you occupy at turn's end.

##### Underworld

You may conquer any Region with a Cavern with 1 less Race token than normal. A minimum of 1 token is still required.

All Regions with a Cavern are also considered adjacent to each other for your conquest purposes.

##### Wealthy

Collect 7 bonus Victory coins, once only, at the end of your first turn.

##### Blank Special Power badge

We have provided you with one additional blank Special Power badge, which you may use to create a Special Power of your own invention. When designing such a Special Power and choosing the number of Race tokens to associate with it, keep in mind that it may end up associated with any possible Race banner. Make sure never to pick a number higher than 5 or you will risk running out of Race tokens you might otherwise have been entitled to during the course of the game.
