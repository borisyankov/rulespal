# Azul: Summer Pavilion Rulebook

## Table of Contents

*At the turn of the 16th Century, King Manuel I commissioned Portugal's greatest artisans to construct grandiose buildings. After completing the Palaces of Evora and Sintra, the king sought to build a Summer Pavilion to honor the most famous members of the royal family. This construction was intended for the most talented artisans-whose skills meet the splendor that the royal family deserves. Sadly, King Manuel I died before construction ever began.*

*In **Azulâ€“Summer Pavilion**, players return to Portugal to accomplish the task that never began. As a master artisan, you must use the finest materials to create the Summer Pavilion while carefully avoiding wasting supplies. Only the best will rise to the challenge to honor the Portuguese royal family.*

## GAME SETUP

1. Each player chooses **a player board** in one player color (as indicated by the colored circle between the red and orange stars) and places it in front of them, so that the side with the colored stars is face up.

2. Place the **Factory displays** in a circle around the center
of the table:

   * In a 2-player game: place 5 Factory displays.
   * In a 3-player game: place 7 Factory displays.
   * In a 4-player game: place 9 Factory displays.

3. Place the **scoring board** next to the Factory displays.

4. Put the **round counter** on the space for round 1. The counter indicates not only the current round, but also the wild color for the round, which will be explained on the next page. In the first round, purple is the wild color.

5. Each player takes **a scoring marker** in their color and places it on the 5th space of the scoring board's scoring track.

6. Fill the **bag** with the 132 **tiles**. Draw 10 tiles blindly from the bag and lay them out at random on the **supply spaces** shown in the center of the scoring board.

7. Fill each Factory display with exactly 4 tiles also drawn
randomly from the bag. Put the bag aside for now.

8. Place the **start player token** in the center of the table.

9. Place the tower between the Factory displays and the scoring board.

10. Put the point tokens aside, they will be used during scoring.

Return any unused player boards, scoring markers and Factory
displays to the box.

## OBJECT OF THE GAME

To be the player with the most points at the end of the game. The game ends after 6 rounds have been played, and a final scoring has taken place.

## GAMEPLAY

Each round consists of the following phases:

**Phase 1:** Acquire tiles  
**Phase 2:** Play tiles and score points  
**Phase 3:** Prepare the next round  
(this phase is not needed in the last round)

The youngest player begins and play proceeds clockwise order. Several turns will be played per round.

### THE WILD COLOR

In each round one of the 6 tile colors is a wild color. The round track shows in which round a color is considered wild. Tiles in that color are helpful in that round because they may be used to replace tiles of any other color.

**Note:** If you have taken tiles in the wild color, they can only be used as wild tiles in the current round. In subsequent rounds, the tiles in this color are no longer wild, because the wild color changes every round!

### PHASE 1: ACQUIRE TILES

On your turn, you must pick tiles. To do so you have two choices:

**A)** Pick **all tiles of the same color**, which is **not** the wild color this round, from any one **Factory display** and place them next to your player board. Move the remaining tiles from this Factory display to the center of the table.

If there are one or more tiles of the wild color on the Factory display, you **must** additionally take **exactly one** of these wild tiles.

If there are **only** tiles of the wild color on the Factory display you have chosen, you are only allowed to take **one** wild tile.

**OR**

**B)** Pick **all tiles of one color**, which is **not** the wild color in this round, from the **center of the table** and place them next to your player board. If there are one or more tiles of the wild color in the center of the table, you **must** additionally take **exactly one** of these wild tiles. If there are **only** tiles of the wild color in the center of the table, you are only allowed to take **one** wild tile.

If you are the first player in this round to pick tiles from the center of the table, take the start player token, placing it next to your player board. Move your scoring marker **backwards** on the scoring track as many spaces as the number of tiles you have picked **this turn** but no further backwards than space 1. If your scoring marker is already on the first space, you may still pick tiles from the center of the table without having to move your scoring marker backwards.

#### THE START PLAYER TOKEN

The player who has the start player token will be the first player to place their tiles on their board in Phase 2; and they will start the following round. This gives them the advantage of choosing tiles from the Factory displays first, according to the normal rules.

After placing the tiles you have taken next to your player board, play proceeds to the next player in clockwise order.

Phase 1 ends when all Factory displays AND the center of the table contain no more tiles. Then, continue with Phase 2.

### PHASE 2: PLAYING AND SCORING TILES

The starting player begins. When it's your turn, first check that you have the **right number** of tiles in the **needed color** next to your player
board to play in a space. If you have enough tiles, then place **exactly one** of these tiles on to the corresponding space of your player board.
Discard the other tiles that were needed into the **tower**. Play then proceeds to the next player in clockwise
order. This process is repeated until no player wishes to or is able to place more tiles.

#### RULES FOR PLACEMENT OF TILES:

* You may only place tiles from those which are next to your own player board.
* Tiles may only be placed on the diamond-shaped spaces on your player board. Do not place tiles on pillars, statues or windows.
* You may only place tiles on empty spaces.
* The spaces are arranged in a star shape. The color of a star indicates which color tiles may be placed there. The numbers on the space indicate the total number of tiles which are needed to be collected before you may place one single tile on that space. All other tiles that were needed to play on this space must be discarded into the tower.
* On the star in the center of the player board, there are no restrictions to where each colored tile may be placed, but all 6 tiles placed must be different colors.
* Tiles that you do not place during a turn should be kept next to your player board.

#### WILD COLOR USE

If you do not have enough tiles, or you do not want to use all your tiles of the needed color, you may use tiles of the current wild color instead. In this case, you must have at least one tile of the color you want to place. All other needed tiles are then discarded into the tower.

#### HINT ON THE USE OF THE WILD TILES!

Wild tiles may replace any other chosen color. In this case, you must combine them with a tile matching the color of the space you wish to play on.

A tile of the wild color may never be placed on a space whose color it replaces. A tile of the wild color may only be placed onto a space of a matching color on the player board.

#### SCORING

For **each tile** that you **place** on your player board, you receive one point. Move your scoring marker one space forward on the scoring track.

If you place a tile **next to one or more connected tiles**, you receive **one point for each of these tiles**. Only spaces that are next to one another on a star are counted as connected spaces.

The scoring track is continuous. If you pass 80 points, take a point token and lay it in front of you, so that you can record your total number of points.

**An additional scoring bonus,** in the form of **additional tiles** from the **supply spaces** on the scoring board, is received when:

* ... you surround the 4 adjacent spaces of **a pillar** with tiles. You must then immediately take any one tile of your choice.
* ... you surround the 4 adjacent spaces of **a statue** with tiles. You must then immediately take any **two** tiles of your choice. If available, these may both be wild tiles.
* ... you surround the 2 adjacent spaces of **a window** with tiles. You must then immediately take any **three** tiles of your choice. If available, these may all be wild tiles.

Place the bonus tiles you received next to your player board.

Before the next player's turn, fill up the empty supply spaces on the scoring board with tiles from the bag. If the bag is empty, refill it with all the tiles contained in the tower and continue to fill the empty spaces.

#### PASSING

If you do not wish to or cannot place tiles on your turn, you must pass. You may choose up to **4 tiles** from those next to your player board to keep into the next round. Place these on the four spaces in the corners of your player board. They do **not** score points.

Any other tiles you have left must be discarded into the tower, and you lose 1 point on the scoring track for each of these discarded tiles. You can no longer take turns in this round.

### PHASE 3: PREPARATION FOR THE NEXT ROUND

This task is performed by the start player.

If you have not yet reached round 6, advance the round counter on to the next round, in which you will start. If you are already in round 6, then move directly to the end of the game.

Fill up the Factory displays with exactly 4 new tiles each, taken randomly from the bag.

If the bag is empty, refill it with all the tiles contained in the tower and then continue to fill up the Factory displays.

In the rare case that the bag is empty and there are no more tiles in the tower, start the next round as usual even though all the Factory displays could not be filled.

Place the start player token back into the center of the table.

Now all players move any tiles they have collected in the corners of their player board, placing them **next** to their player board.

## END OF THE GAME

The game ends after 6 rounds. Then players check to see if they meet the following goals and adjust their scoring marker accordingly.

* If you completed the **multicolored** star (in the center of your player board), score 12 points.
* If you completed the **red** star, score 14 points.
* If you completed the **blue** star, score 15 points.
* If you completed the **yellow** star, score 16 points.
* If you completed the **orange** star, score 17 points.
* If you completed the **green** star, score 18 points.
* If you completed the **purple** star, score 20 points.
* If you covered **all 1's**, score 4 points.
* If you covered **all 2's**, score 8 points.
* If you covered **all 3's**, score 12 points.
* If you covered **all 4's**, score 16 points.

After the final round, if you have tiles on the spaces in the corners of your player board that you haven't used, discard them into the tower and lose 1 point per tile.

Whoever has the most points is the winner. In the case of a tie, players share the victory.

## VARIANT PLAY

For a slightly different play, all players turn their player board to the other side, showing the monochrome stars. The rules are identical to those of the normal game, with the following exceptions:

* During the game you, have the choice of which colors you place in the star shapes (for all 7 stars).
  * If you choose to make a multicolored star, all 6 tiles must have a **different color**, as in the normal game.
  * If you choose to make a single-colored star, all tiles must be the **same color**.
* More than one star in a color, or more than one multicolored star, are allowed. You receive points for these stars as described in the normal rules.
* Note that the numbers on the stars are different on the other side of the player board.
