# DVONN Rulebook

## Table of Contents

*Build stacks, try to control your opponent’s pieces and, above all, remain linked to the red DVONN pieces. If you do not? Well, you may suddenly see quite a few of your pieces disappear from the board. Be aware of everything your opponent does, but do not forget to watch your step, too. If you do not? Well, you may be forced to make moves you really do not want to make and, then, strange things can happen...*

## AIM OF THE GAME

Control as many pieces as possible by stacking them on top of each other and try to keep your stacks linked to the red DVONN pieces. When no more moves can be made, the player who controls the most pieces wins the game.

## PREPARATION

1. Draw lots to determine who begins. The starting player takes 2 DVONN pieces and the 23 white pieces; the other player takes the remaining DVONN piece and the 23 black pieces.
2. Place the board horizontally between the players so that each player has 9 intersections on their side. Intersections are called spaces.

## THE FIRST PHASE: PLACING PIECES

1. The game starts with an empty board. The players take turns placing their pieces on the spaces of the board, one at a time.

   **They must start with the DVONN pieces and
   after that continue with their own color:**  
   White: first DVONN piece  
   Black: second DVONN piece  
   White: third DVONN piece  
   Black: first black piece  
   White: first white piece  
   Black: second black piece  
   … and so on…  
2. A piece may be put on any vacant space, without restriction.
3. When all the pieces are placed on the board, all spaces will be occupied. This is the end of the first phase.

## THE SECOND PHASE: STACKING PIECES

1. **IMPORTANT: the player who started the first phase also starts the second phase!** Thus, after White has put their last piece on the board, they must immediately play again. Then the players alternate turns. (As Black is the first to put a piece of their own color on the board in the first phase, so now it is White who may first move one of their pieces.)
2. Each turn the players must move one piece or one stack. They may only move a piece or a stack of their own color. When two or more pieces are stacked on top of each other, the color of the topmost piece determines who owns the stack, and thus which player may move it.
3. A single piece may move one space in any direction, but **only to an occupied space** (i.e. on top of another piece or stack of **any color**).
4. A stack must always be moved as a whole and moves as many spaces as there are pieces in the stack. Thus, a stack of 3 pieces (regardless of their color) must be moved exactly 3 spaces. Just like a single piece, a stack may be moved in any direction, but **always in a straight line**.
5. A move may never end in an empty space, but it is allowed to move across one or more empty spaces. When making a move, each space must be counted, no matter whether it is empty or occupied.
6. **IMPORTANT: a piece or stack that is surrounded on all 6 sides may not be moved.** So, at the beginning of the game only the pieces at the edge of the board may move. The pieces that are not positioned at the edge remain blocked for as long as they remain completely surrounded.
7. A single DVONN piece may not be moved, but a piece or stack may move on top of it. When a DVONN piece is part of a stack, it is perfectly legal to move the stack containing the DVONN piece– but, as explained above, only by the player who controls the stack.
8. You may not pass a turn, unless you cannot make any more moves.

## LOSING PIECES

1. Pieces and stacks must somehow remain in contact with at least one DVONN piece to remain in play. “In contact” means that there must always be a link (directly or through a chain of other pieces) with at least one DVONN piece. Each and every piece and/ or stack that is not linked to any of the DVONN pieces, must be removed from the board at once. Be careful: it may happen that a great number of pieces are suddenly removed as a result of one single move. If White moves the indicated piece, the pieces on the left will no longer be in contact with a DVONN piece. They must be removed from the board.
2. All removed pieces go out of the game. It does not matter who makes the move through which the pieces and.or stacks become isolated. Watch out for this, especially in the endgame. Since you may not pass, you may be forced to make a move that isolates one or more of your own stacks.
3. All 3 DVONN pieces remain in play until the end of the game, even if one of them becomes isolated, as it will always remain in contact with itself.

## END OF THE GAME

1. The players must play for as long as they can do so. If one player cannot make a move any more, the other must continue to play until that player has no more moves. In the rare event that a player who must pass gets the opportunity to make a move again, they must do so. This can happen when one or more of a player’s pieces are blocked (i.e. completely surrounded).
2. The game ends when the last move is made. At this point, the players puts all of the stacks they control on top of each other. The player with the highest stack wins the game, regardless of the color of the pieces in their stack.
3. If both players end up with an equal stack, then the game ends in a tie. Note: if the stacks are equally high or if the difference is only one piece, then do count the pieces to be sure. As a result of the manufacturing process of the pieces, their thickness may differ slightly.

## STRATEGIC TIPS

1. **Phase 1:** when placing the pieces on the board, make sure that you put enough of them at the edge and close to the DVONN pieces. Do not put too many of your pieces close together.
2. **Phase 2:** when making a move, you neutralize an opponent’s piece each time you play on top of one. A neutralized piece is like a piece that is captured (it remains in play, indeed, nonetheless it is one piece less for your opponent to play with).
3. Try to keep as many of your pieces mobile. Keep in mind that the higher a stack gets, the more difficult it becomes to move.
4. Be careful when your opponent is in control of a DVONN piece. Check where they can go to with the DVONN piece and how many of your pieces will have to be removed if they move it.
5. The last moves are very important. Often the player with the most mobile pieces at the ending stage of the game will eventually win. In other words: try to make your opponent must pass his turn before you must do so yourself.
