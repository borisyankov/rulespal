# King of Tokyo Rulebook

## Table of Contents

You are giant Monsters on a rampage. Your destructive feats earn you glory in the form of Victory Points.

The first to get to 20 wins the game. Or the last standing - if y'all want to take that route...

## CONTENTS

* Rules
* 1 Tokyo board
* 66 cards
* 28 "counters" (3 Smoke, 1 Mimic, 12 Shrink, 12 Poison).
* 8 dice (6 black + 2 green)
* 6 carton figures + 6 plastic stand up
* A bunch of Energy cubes

## GOAL OF THE GAME

The goal of the game is to become King of Tokyo. The game is over when a Monster earns 20 Victory Points or if it is the last Monster standing.

## SETTING UP

Each player chooses a Monster, takes its figure, its Monster board and sets its life Points to 10 and its Victory Points to 0. Place the Tokyo board at the center of the table, within easy access of every player. It represents the City of Tokyo divided into two distinct places: "Tokyo City" and "Tokyo Bay". Every time a card refers to Tokyo it refers to both places.

**At the beginning of the game, nobody is in Tokyo.**

If this is your first game or if there are 4 players or less, you will only use "Tokyo City".

For a 5 or 6 player game, also use "Tokyo Bay".

Shuffle the cards to form a deck and deal the first three cards face up on the table next to the deck and the counters.

Put the 6 black dice at the cen- ter of the table and set the green ones aside (they will be used only with special cards).

Finally, form a pool with all the Energy cubes.

## GAME OVERVIEW

**Every players rolls the 6 black dice. The one who has the most "Attack" goes first.**

*Note: Throughout the rules players will be referred to as Monsters.*

Starting with the first player, each Monster takes a turn and then the turn goes to the next player to the left. A turn consists of the following, in the given order:

### TURN OVERVIEW

1. **Rolling and rerolling the dice**
2. **Resolving the dice**
3. **Buying cards** (optional)
4. **End of your turn**

### 1. ROLLING AND REROLLING THE DICE

On your turn you roll all 6 dice.

Then you can reroll any or all of the dice, twice.

Dice kept on the first reroll can be kept again or rerolled on the second.

### 2. RESOLVING THE DICE

The symbols you get at the end of
your rolling step are the actions for
this turn.

#### Dice overview:

The dice bear the following symbols.

* 1/2/3 - Victory Points
* Energy
* Attack
* Heal

### DICE EFFECTS

### VICTORY POINTS

If a triple 1, 2, or 3 is rolled a Monster scores that many Victory Points (that is, three 3 are worth 3 VP - not 9).

Each additional roll of that type is worth an additional VP.

### ENERGY

Each **Energy** result allows the Monster to take an Energy Cube.

There is no need to roll triples.

Energy Cubes can be saved from turn to turn.

### ATTACK

Each **Attack** results in a point of
damage dealt to Monsters who
are not in the same place as you.

* **If you are in Tokyo** (Tokyo City or Tokyo Bay) when you get **Attack** you deal damage to all the Monsters who are not in Tokyo.
* **If you are outside Tokyo** when you get **Attack** you deal damage to all the Monsters who are inTokyo (Tokyo City or Tokyo Bay).

Each damage results in the loss of one Life.

If a Monster loses its last life it is out of the game.

The first Monster in the game to obtain at least 1 **Attack** damage, but takes control of Tokyo, and moves its figure to Tokyo City instead.

### HEAL

Each **Heal** allows a Monster to regain one lost Life.

A Monster can't go above 10 Life.

#### Card description:

**The cost** of the card is in the
upper left corner and is paid in
accumulated Energy cubes.

**How to play** the card is
indicated above the description of
the effect.

**KEEP**: Monsters keep these cards for the remain- der of the game (sometimes the card will indicate it is discarded under certain circumstances.)

**DISCARD**: Monsters immediately resolve these then discard them.

**Effect** of the card is at the bottom.

### 3. BUYING CARDS

Optionally, after the dice are resolved, a Monster may purchase any of the three face up cards.

Two energy Points can also be spent to sweep (discard) all the shown cards and reveal 3 new cards.

Purchases and sweeps can be done in any order and as long as a Monster has energy to spend.

***Example:** Kraken has 10 Energy and doesn't want any of the three available cards. He spends 2 Energy and discards them, revealing 3 new ones. Now he has 8 Energy and he sees a 3 Energy cost card he wants. He purchases it, and reveals a new one. He has 5 Energy left, and decides to save it for another turn.*

**Purchased cards are immediately replaced from the top of the deck.**

### 4. END OF YOUR TURN

Some card effects are resolved during this step.

It is the end of your turn, hand the dice to the player on your left.

## BECOMING KING OF TOKYO

At the start of the game no Monster is in Tokyo.

If Tokyo is unoccupied, the first Monster to obtain at least one **Attack** gets the control of Tokyo and places his figure in Tokyo without dealing any damage.

If you are attacked while in To- kyo and you don't want to be there anymore (and who can blame you - it can be rough!) you can yeld to the Monster that attacked. You still take the da- mage, however.

If you are eliminated while in Tokyo, the Monster who has eliminated you automatically takes control of Tokyo.

**Warning: a Discard card that deals damage to you is not an attack.**

**If you are eliminated by such a card, nobody takes your place and Tokyo becomes unoccupied.**

When playing with 5 or 6 Monsters you may have two Monsters at the same time in Tokyo.

### EFFECT OF TOKYO

Being in Tokyo (Tokyo City or Tokyo Bay) has some advantages and disadvantages:

* When taking control of Tokyo you gain 1 VP
* When starting the turn in Tokyo you gain 2 VP
* The Monster in Tokyo cannot use the **Heal** result on the dice (but can heal using cards).

Targets of your attack depend also on where you are:

* **Attack** by the Monster in Tokyo City and Tokyo Bay deal damage to all the Monsters not in Tokyo.
* Another Monster's **Attack** deal damage just to the Monster in Tokyo City and Tokyo Bay.

## WINNING THE GAME

The game is over when a Monster scores 20 Victory Points or is the last Monster standing.

The Monster who gains 20 VP or the last one standing wins the game and is crowned King of To- kyo.

### ADVANCED RULE

**Tokyo Bay** - Rules for 5 to 6 experienced Monsters.

When playing with 5 or 6 Monsters you may want to add Tokyo Bay to the game. This position opens up a little extra room in Tokyo, which is nice with a lot of monsters.

**Monsters either in Tokyo City or in Tokyo Bay are considered "in Tokyo‚Äù.**

After a Monster that is not in Tokyo attacks, it must occupy Tokyo if either Tokyo City or Tokyo Bay places are unoccupied or abandoned. If there is a choice Tokyo City must be occupied first.

As in a regular game the Monster who takes control of Tokyo City while it is unoccupied doesn't deal damage.

If Tokyo Bay is unoccupied but Tokyo City is, the Monster who at- tacks Tokyo deals damage to the monster controlling it, then takes control of Tokyo Bay - or Tokyo City if the damaged monster abandons Tokyo City.

**Tokyo Bay acts like Tokyo City.**

* If the Monster in Tokyo Bay is attacked it can choose to abandon Tokyo Bay (still taking any damage dealt, just like Tokyo City). In this case the Monster that attacked must move in unless it is moving into Tokyo City, in which case Tokyo Bay becomes temporarily unoccupied.
* A Monster can never occupy both Tokyo City and Tokyo Bay.

If a Monster is eliminated and that brings the number of Monsters be- low 5, Tokyo Bay can't be occupied anymore. The Monster in it must leave Tokyo.

Any card that refers Tokyo applies to both Tokyo City and Tokyo Bay.

### UNDERSTANDING THE CARDS

* When a card says a number followed by a start it **indicates how many Victory Points** the purchaser gets. For example, Skyscrapers when purchased are discarded and the purchaser gains 4 VP.
* It is possible for a player to get 20 VP and be eliminated on the same turn due to cards. You must survive the turn to claim Victory. It is also possible for all Monsters to be eliminated at once. Too bad ... you all lose!
* A card cannot put a Monster over 10 Health unless it specifically says it can.

### GLOSSARY

* **Reroll**: When a card says "reroll" it means an additional reroll during the Monster's turn of as many dice as it wants, unless the card specifies that only a single die is rolled.
* **Damage**: Lose
* **Attack/Attacking Monster**: A Monster is considered attacking when it has at least one **Attack** otherwise it is not attacking. This means that a card which increases damage of an attack will not bring damage from zero to one if you don't have an **Attack**.

If an attack somehow ends up doing no damage (due to Camouflage for example), then it is no longer considered an attack for the purposes of cards like Poison Spit or Herbivore.

If a card deals damage when purchased (like Gas Refinery), this is not considered an attack. Monsters cannot yield Tokyo based on this damage, and cards that affect attacks do not affect these cards.

* **Leaving Tokyo/Flee**: A Monster can leave Tokyo (yield his place) to the Monster who just attacked him. If a card allows a monster to leave tokyo with no damage from an attack, the attacker still occupies Tokyo.

* Eliminated: when you have 0 Health.

### SPECIAL CARDS OVERVIEW

#### EVEN BIGGER !

If this card is lost you lose the 2 Health you gained when you got it.

#### EATER OF THE DEAD

A player that remains in the game because of "It has a Child" is still considered to have been down to 0 Health.

#### PARASITIC TENTACLES

You can only purchase powers when it is your turn to purchase cards. If the card has counters on it the counters are transferred.

#### MIMIC

If the card being copied leaves play for any reason (such as the Monster that owns it being eliminated), take the mimic counter back. You can place it on a new power at the start of your turn like normal by paying 1 Energy. If the copied card has counters on it then use your own counters as if you just played that card.

#### OPPORTUNIST

If there are two opportunists the first clockwise from the Monster whose turn it is gets the first opportunity to buy newly revealed cards.

#### FIRE BREATHING

The damage dealt is added to any attack you do against that neighbor. If the neighbor is not being attacked then the damage is not considered an attack.

#### METAMORPH

The sale of powers is after you purchase powers. You can sell a power you just purchased.

#### SOLAR POWERED

You can use this on the turn it is purchased.

#### DROP FROM HIGH ALTITUDE

If you are in Tokyo Bay, you are in Tokyo, so you do not take Tokyo City.

#### SPIT POISON & SHRINK RAY

Poison and Shrink counters stay in play and in effect even if Poison Spit leaves play.
