# Puerto Rico Rulebook

## Table of Contents

Prospector, captain, mayor, trader, settler, craftsman, or builder?

Which roles will you play in the new world? Will you own the most prosperous plantations?  
Will you build the most valuable buildings?  
You have but one goal: achieve the greatest prosperity and highest respect!  
This goal is attained by the player who earns the most victory points!

## GOAL

**The game** is played over several rounds. In each round, each player chooses one of seven different roles and, thereby, offers *all* players, in clockwise order, the action associated with that role.

For example, with the settler, players can place new plantations, on which, with the help of the craftsman, players can produce goods. Players can then sell these goods to the trading house with the trader or, with the captain, ship them to the old world. With the money earned from such sales, the players, with the builder, may build buildings in the city, and so on.

The player who best manages the changing roles with their associated actions and special privileges, will achieve the greatest prosperity and the highest respect and, thereby, win the game.

**The winner is the player who earns the most victory points.**

## PREPARATION (BASIC GAME: 3-5 PLAYERS)

Place the **game board** with the large bank in the middle of the table. Place all the basic buildings on their respective spaces on the board with either the long text descriptions (for new players) or the shorter explanations (for experienced players) face up.

Sort the **54 doubloons** by value and place them on the bank on the game board (see below).

**Each player takes:**

* **1 player board** (placed before them on the table - their play area)
* **money:**
  * with 3 players: 2 doubloons
  * with 4 players: 3 doubloons
  * with 5 players: 4 doubloons  
 *The players store their doubloons on the windrose on their player boards, so that all players can see how much money each has.*
* 1 **plantation tile** (which they place face-up on any of the 12 island spaces on their player board).  
The players choose a starting player using any method they choose. This player takes the governor placard and a small indigo tile.
The other players take the following in clockwise order:
  * **with 3 players:** 2nd player: 1 indigo tile / 3rd player: 1 corn tile
  * **with 4 players:** 2nd player: 1 indigo tile / 3rd and 4th players: each 1 corn tile
  * **with 5 players:** 2nd and 3rd players: each 1 indigo tile / 4th and 5th players: each 1 corn

## PLAYING THE GAME

The game is played over several rounds (about 15). Each round is played in the same way. The player with the governor placard begins. They take one of the role placards, place it face-up next to their player board, and take the action allowed by the role placard. Then, the player on their left takes the action allowed by that role placard, and so on around the table, in clockwise order, until every player has taken this action once.

Next, the player on the left of the governor takes their turn: the player takes one of the remaining role placards, places it face-up next to their player board, and takes the action allowed by the role placard. Then, the player on their left takes the action allowed by that role placard, and so on around the table, in clockwise order, until every player has taken this action once. Then, the left neighbor takes a role placard, and so on until all players have taken a role placard and all players have taken the actions allowed by the role placards taken.

Next, place one doubloon on each of the three role placards that were not taken by a player during the round. Then, place the used role placards back on the table next to the unused placards. The left neighbor of the player with the governor placard takes the governor placard, becoming the governor for the next round. The player with the governor placard begins the round and the game continues as before.

### The roles

Each role grants the player who takes the placard a special privilege, and also, a specific action that can be taken by each player, in clockwise order, starting with the player who took the role *(exception: prospector)*.

Basic rules for all role placards:

* If a placard has one or more doubloons on it, the player who takes it also takes the doubloons in addition to the privilege and action associated with it.
* The action associated with a role placard is always taken first by the player who took the placard, followed by the others in clockwise order.
* Players must always take a role placard when it is their turn to do so, but they may choose not to use the action or privilege of the placard chosen. The other players, of course, get their turns at the action of the placard.
* The action of a role placard is optional (exception: captain). Players may choose not to or be unable to use the action on their turn.
* A role placard remains in front of the player who took it until the end of the round. It may not be taken by another player in the same round.

### The Settler

**(settler phase → players place new plantations on their island spaces)**

The player who chooses this role may take either a quarry tile as the privilege or one of the face-up plantation tiles and place it on any empty island space on their player board. Afterwards, each other player, in clockwise order, may take one of the face-up plantation tiles (not a quarry tile! - *exception: construction hut*) and place it on any empty island space on their player board.

Finally, the settler player puts the untaken plantation tiles face-up on a plantation discard stack and draws new plantation tiles from the face-down stacks, placing them face-up next to the quarry stack. The player draws *one more* than the number of players.

Notes:

* Remember the special functions of the hacienda, construction hut, and hospice.
* If there are not enough plantation tiles left in the face-down stacks, the player first draws and
places the remaining tiles, if any. The player shuffles the discarded plantation tiles face-down,
creates five new face down stacks, and fills the face-up row. If there are insufficient tiles to
refill the face-up row, players in following rounds may have to do without.
* Where players place quarry and plantation tiles on their island plays no role in the game.
These tiles may not be removed from the island.
* When a player has filled all 12 island spaces on their player board, they may not take any
further tiles in the settler phases for the rest of the game.
* The taking of a plantation tile is voluntary. Thus, the player need not take one.
* When there are no more quarry tiles in the quarry tile stack, the settler may not use their privilege and the owner of the construction hut may not use that special function.

### The Mayor

**(Mayor phase → arrival of new colonists)**

The tiles (plantation, quarry, or building) have 1 to 3 circles. Players *may* place one colonist on each circle on the tiles on their player boards. If there is at least one colonist on a tile, it is considered occupied. Only occupied tiles may use their functions; unoccupied tiles *never* function!

The player who chooses this role may first take one colonist from the colonist supply (not from the colonist ship!) as the privilege. Next, the players take the colonists from the colonist ship one at a time, starting with the mayor. The players continue to take one colonist at a time, in clockwise order, until none remain on the colonist ship.

Players may place their new colonist(s), **together** with *all* the colonists acquired from earlier rounds, on any *empty circles* on the tiles on their player boards. Thus, players may move a colonist placed on a circle or on their windrose in an earlier round. If a player cannot place all their colonists, they must “store” them on their windrose on their player board. The colonists remain there until a later mayor phase when they may be placed on empty circles on the player’s tiles.

As their last duty, the mayor puts new colonists on the colonist ship to be used in the next mayor phase. For each empty circle on the **buildings** on the player boards of *all* players (empty circles on plantations and quarries do not count!), the mayor takes one colonist from the colonist supply and places it on the colonist ship. However, as a minimum, the mayor should always place at least as many colonists on the ship as there are players in the game.

Notes:

* Usually, all players place/move their colonists at the same time. If, however, the players feel that their placement decisions may depend on other’s placements, the players should place their colonists in the following order: first, the mayor and, then, the others in clockwise order from the mayor.
* If a mayor forgets (players may remind them) to place new colonists on the colonist ship, players later place the minimum (number of players) on the colonist ship.
* When the colonist supply runs out, the mayor may not use this privilege and, of course, does not refill the colonist ship.
* Players may not choose to place colonists on their windrose if they have empty circles available on their player board. All empty circles must be filled, if possible. Colonists may only be placed on the circles in the mayor phase.

### The Builder

**(Builder phase → build buildings)**

The player who chooses this role can immediately build **one** building for one doubloon less than the normal cost as the privilege. The player pays the money to the bank, takes the building from the supply, and places it on any empty space in the city on their player board. When placing a large building, the player needs two adjacent empty spaces. Then, the other players, in clockwise order from the builder, may each build one building (at normal cost) in the same way.

Note: No player may build more than one building per round.  
*For further information on the individual buildings, please see page 8 of these rules.*

### Quarry

Each occupied quarry that a player owns may reduce the player’s cost for building a building by 1 *doubloon*. The limit for such reductions is shown on the game board: players building buildings in the first column can reduce their cost by at most 1 doubloon *(1 occupied quarry)*, in the second column by 2 doubloons *(2 occupied quarries)*, in the third column by 3 doubloons *(3 occupied quarries)*, and in the fourth column by 4 doubloons *(4 occupied quarries)*.

The builder’s privilege reduction is in addition to the quarry reduction, but the cost of a building may not be reduced below 0 doubloons. A player with 3 occupied quarries pays the following costs: construction hut: 1 doubloon; office: 3 doubloons; harbor: 5 doubloons; city hall: 7 doubloons.

**Note:**

* *Remember the special function of the university.*
* *If the builder does not build a building, the player takes no doubloon for the privilege!*
* *It is not possible to build on more than 12 city spaces. A player who has no empty city spaces may not build more buildings.*

### The Craftsman

**(Craftsman phase → produce goods))**

The player who chooses this role takes goods from the supply according to their production ability and places them on the windrose on their player board. Thus, the windrose contains a player’s money, goods, and unused colonists. Next, the other players take goods from the supply according to their abilities, in clockwise order from the craftsman.

As his last duty, the craftsman takes one additional good (of those the player produced this turn) from the supply as the privilege.

**Notes:**

* *Remember the special function of the factory.*
* *If the kind of good a player produces is exhausted in the supply, the player takes none of that good (and may not take a different good as a replacement for the missing good).*
* *If the craftsman does not produce goods, they do not get an extra good (privilege).*

### The Trader

**(Trader phase → sell goods)**

The player who chooses this role, may immediately sell *one* good to the trading house. The player places the sold good on any empty space on the trading house and takes from the bank the price associated with the good sold (0-4 doubloons) plus 1 doubloon as the privilege. Then, in clockwise order from the trader, each other player *may* sell *one* good to the trading house for the price shown as long as there is room for it in the trading house. The trading phase ends when all players have had one turn to sell or when the trading house is full.

When selling, use the following rules:

* The trading house has room for just *four* goods. When it is full, no other players may sell goods in this trading phase.
* The trading house buys only *different* kinds of goods. If a good of one type is in the trading house, no more of that good can be sold to the trading house until the trading house is emptied. (exception: *office*).

As his last duty, the trader empties the trading house if it is full with four goods, placing them in their separate supply piles. If there are fewer than four goods in the trading house, they remain there. *It will be more difficult to sell goods in the next trader phase, because of the kinds of goods already there and the fewer number of spaces available.*

**Note:**

* *Remember the special functions of the small and large markets and the office.*
* *If the trader does not sell, the player does not collect the extra doubloon (privilege).*
* *A player may sell corn to the trading house even when the player earns no money for doing so.*

### The Captain

**(Captain phase → ship goods)**

The captain is in charge of shipping goods to the old world. This means that the captain is the first to load goods on the cargo ships. Then, the other players follow, in clockwise order from the captain. The captain phase continues, clockwise around the table, as long as at least one player has goods they can load.

***Note:** in the captain phase, each player may get several turns to load goods on the cargo ships. When it is a player’s turn to load goods on a cargo ship, they must load if they can. However, a player may load goods of only one kind on a turn. On their turn, a player may choose freely which good to load of those they can load.*

### Loading/shipping rules

When shipping, players must follow these rules:

* Each cargo ship will carry goods of only one kind.
* Players may not load goods on a cargo ship if goods of that same kind are on one of the other two cargo ships.
* Players may not load goods on a full ship.
* On a player’s turn, the player must load goods if possible. However, they may only load one kind of good and to only one ship.
* When players load goods of a kind, they must load as many of that kind as they can. Players cannot hold back goods when there is space on a ship carrying the kind of goods they have. If players have a kind of good that can be loaded on several empty ships, they must choose the ship where they can load the most goods, leaving none behind, if possible.
* If a player has several kinds of goods that they can load, they may choose freely which goods to load. *Players need not choose the goods that would allow them to load the most goods.*

### VP (victory points)

For *each* good (each good, not each kind of good) players load, they earn 1 VP in the form of value 1 VP chips. When loading goods onto the cargo ships, all kinds of goods have the same value: 1 VP per good loaded! The goods values used in the trader phase are not used here. When loading the first kind of goods, the captain takes as the privilege 1 extra VP. The captain does not get this extra VP for the goods loaded in subsequent turns in this captain phase.

Players keep VP secret from the others, unlike their money and goods.

Players put their VP chips face-down on their windroses. From time to time, players should convert 5 value 1 chips for a single value 5 chip.

### Goods storage

When no more goods can be loaded on the cargo ships, the players must store the goods left on their windroses. Each player may store *one* good (one token) on their windrose. For all other remaining goods, each player must find room in one of their warehouses (small or large). Players who do not have sufficient warehouse space must place all extra goods back in the goods supplies (see more information under *“small warehouse”*).

As the last duty, the captain unloads all full ships by placing those goods back in their separate supply piles. Partially full and empty ships remain as they are until the next captain phase. *It will be more difficult to load goods in the next captain phase, because of the kinds of goods already on the cargo ships and the fewer number of spaces available.*

Note:

* *Remember the special functions of the small and large warehouses, the harbor, and the wharf.*
* *When players cannot store all their extra goods, they may choose which goods to store and which to return to the goods supply.*
* *The captain earns only one extra VP as the privilege, regardless of how many kinds of goods the captain loads. If the captain loads no goods, the captain earns no extra privilege VP.*
* *Players only check for goods storage at the end of the captain phase. Players store goods acquired in other phases on the windroses without limit until the next captain phase.*

### The Prospector

The player who chooses this role initiates no action for the players, but receives as their privilege 1 doubloon from the bank.

#### A new round ...

After the last player in the round takes a role and all players complete the action, if any, of the role, the round ends. Now, the governor takes three doubloons from the bank, placing one each on the three role placards that were not selected during the round. The doubloons are placed regardless of the number of doubloons already on the placards. Role placards with more doubloons will be more attractive to the players as they get the doubloons in addition to the privilege of the placard. *For example, a player choosing a prospector placard with 2 doubloons on it will get, in total, 3 doubloons for their effort.*

Finally, the players return the role placards they selected to the area next to the game board and the governor gives the governor placard to their left neighbor. The new governor begins the next round by selecting a role placard.

## GAME END

The game ends *at the end* of the round, in which at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:

* at the end of the mayor phase there are not enough colonists to fill the colonist ship as required;
* during the builder phase, at least one player builds on their 12th city space;
* during the captain phase, the last of the VP chips is taken.

*When the VP chips are exhausted, players earning VP thereafter should track them with pencil and paper.*

The players' VP are now summed with pencil and paper. Each player adds:

* the value of their VP chips (including those noted on pencil and paper) +
* the VP value of their buildings *(red-brown number in upper right corner)* +
* the extra VP scored by their occupied large buildings

**Note:** A building scores its VP even when it is not occupied.  
*Thus, for example, the five large buildings score 4 VP each when they are not occupied.*

The five large buildings score the extra VP only when they are occupied!

The player with the most VP is the winner! If two or more players tie with the most VP, the player with the most doubloons and goods counted together (1 good = 1 doubloon) is the winner.

## THE BUILDINGS

For *all* buildings:

* Each player may build each building only *once*.
* When at least one colonist is in the building, it is *considered* occupied. Only occupied buildings can be used or have value *(exception: VP)*.
* Where a building is placed in the city has no bearing on the game. A building is placed on an empty city space. A large building requires two adjacent empty city spaces. A building may be moved within the city to make room for a large building. However, as with the plantation and quarry tiles on the island, players may not *remove* a building from their city for any reason such as to make room for another building or to prolong the game).
* The red-brown number in the upper right corner of each building indicates how many VP the building is worth (occupied or unoccupied) at the end of the game.
* The number in the first circle is the cost to build the building. Once built, the building cost has no further role in the game.

### The production buildings (blue, white, light and dark brown)

The production buildings are required, together with the plantations, for the production of certain goods:

* In the indigo processing plants, the indigo plants are processed to produce indigo dye (blue goods).
* In the sugar mills, sugar cane is processed into sugar (white goods).
* In the tobacco storage, the tobacco leaves are shredded into tobacco (light brown goods).
* In the coffee roasters, the coffee beans are roasted into coffee (dark brown goods).
* **Note:** there is no production facility needed for the corn. Corn (yellow goods) come *directly* from the plantation without any need for processing. That means that, in the craftsman phase, occupied corn plantations produce corn *directly*.

The number of circles on the production buildings indicates the maximum number of goods the building can produce when the circles have colonists on them. Of course, the player must also have sufficient occupied plantations of the appropriate kind to produce the raw materials needed to produce the goods in the production buildings.

### The beige buildings

There are 17 different beige buildings: there two each of the 12 small buildings and one each of the 5 large buildings.

The special functions of the beige buildings tend to allow players to do things outside of the normal game rules. *So, for example, the owner of an **occupied** office may sell a kind of good to the trading house that is already there.*

Players are not required to use the special function of an occupied beige building if they do not want to *(important with the wharf, see below)*.

#### Small market

When the owner of an occupied small market sells a good in the trader phase, they get an extra doubloon from the bank for it.

*Example: Anna sells a corn and receives 1 doubloon.*

#### Hacienda

On their turn in the settler phase, the owner of an occupied hacienda may, *before* they take a face-up plantation tile, take an *additional plantation* tile from any facedown stack (the top-most) and place it on an empty space on their island. The player may then take their normal turn in the phase.

***Note:** if a player chooses to take a face-down tile, they must immediately place it on an empty space on their island. They may not discard it. If the player also owns an occupied construction hut, they may not take a quarry instead of the face-down tile. If the settler owns a hacienda, they may only take one quarry.*

#### Construction hut

In the settler phase, the owner of an occupied construction hut can place a quarry on their island instead of one of the face-up plantation tiles.

***Note:** if the settler owns a construction hut they may, of course, only take one quarry.*

#### Small warehouse

As described under the captain, players must store their unloaded goods at the end of the captain phase. When players do not have sufficient storage space, they must return the goods to the goods supplies.

Owners of an occupied small warehouse may store, at the end of the captain phase, in addition to the single good they are allowed to store on their windrose, all the goods of one kind that they choose. The warehouse protects the player from returning goods to the supply. It does not protect the player from being required to load the goods onto the cargo ships.

***Note:** the goods chosen are not actually stored on the small warehouse tile, but on the player’s windrose.*

#### Hospice

During the settler phase, when the owner of an occupied hospice places a plantation or quarry tile on their island, they may take a colonist from the *colonist supply* and place it on the newly acquired plantation or quarry tile.

***Note:** players who also own an occupied hacienda and choose to take the additional facedown or quarry tile do not get a colonist for the extra tile. If there are no more colonists in the colonist supply, the player may take one from the colonist ship. If there are also none there, the player takes none.*

#### Office

When the owner of an occupied office sells a good to the trading house in the trader phase, it need not be different than the goods already there. If the trading house is full, the player cannot sell a good there!

***Example:** the trading house already has a tobacco good. Bob owns an occupied office and, on his turn, sells a tobacco to the trading house. Chris owns the other office and it is occupied. On her turn, she too can sell a tobacco to the trading house.*

#### Large Market

When the owner of an occupied large market sells a good in the trader phase, they get an extra 2 doubloons from the bank for it.

***Note:** if a player owns both a small and large market, they take an extra 3 doubloons when they sell a good to the trading house.*

#### Large warehouse

The owner of an occupied large warehouse may store, at the end of the captain phase, in *addition* to the single goods token they are allowed to store on their windrose, all the tokens of two kinds of goods that they choose.

***Note:** players who own both a small and large warehouse may store all the tokens of 3 kinds of goods that they choose.*

#### Factory

Owners of an occupied factory producing goods of more than *one* kind in the craftsman phase earn money from the bank: for two *kinds* of goods, they earn 1 doubloon, for three *kinds* of goods, they earn 2 doubloons, for four *kinds* of goods, they earn 3 doubloons, and for all five **kinds** of goods, they earn 5 doubloons. The number of goods produced plays no role.

***Example:** David owns an occupied factory, 3 occupied corn plantations, 3 occupied sugar plantations, 1 occupied tobacco plantation, and the associated production buildings with the necessary number of colonists. He produces only 2 sugar and 1 tobacco as there is no corn and only 2 sugar goods tokens in the supply. He earns 1 doubloon from the bank for producing 2 kinds of goods.*

#### University

During the builder phase, when the owner of an occupied university builds a building in his city, they may take a colonist from the *colonist supply* and place it on the newly acquired tile.

***Note:** if a player builds a production building with more than one circle, they get only one colonist. If there are no more colonists in the colonist supply, they may take one from the colonist ship. If there are also none there, they take none.*

#### Harbor

Each time, during the captain phase, owners of an occupied harbor load goods on a cargo ship, they earn one extra VP.

***Example:** Anna has an occupied harbor (and an occupied wharf ) and can only load 3 of her 5 tobacco on the “tobacco ship”. As those 3 fill it up, she earns 3+1 VP. In her next loading turn, she loads both her 2 sugar on the “sugar ship”: she earns 2+1 VP. In her next loading turn, she uses her wharf to put her remaining 2 tobacco in the supply: she earns 2+1 VP. Thus, in this captain phase she has earned an additional 3 VP with the use of her harbor and 2 VP extra with her wharf.*

#### Wharf

During the captain phase, when a player with an occupied wharf must load goods, *instead* of loading them on a cargo ship, they may place all goods of one kind in the goods supply and score the appropriate VP as though they had loaded them on a cargo ship. *It is as though the player has an imaginary ship with unlimited capacity at their disposal.*

Players must load goods on a cargo ship whenever they can on their turn during the captain phase, except when they choose to use their wharf and “load” them on their imaginary ship.

The wharf can only be used *once* per captain phase by its owner, but the player may choose when to use it, if at all. This imaginary ship can take any number of any one good, and it may be of a kind on one of the three cargo ships or the other imaginary wharf ship.

***Note:** when players use a wharf, they must load all the goods tokens of the kind they choose that they have. They are not required to choose the good they have the most of. An imaginary wharf ship has the capacity for 11 barrels.*

### The large buildings

The following five large buildings occur just once each in the game. Each needs two adjacent city spaces to be built, but it counts as *one* building.

***Note:** when, in these rules, “large building” is mentioned, it is the following five buildings that are described!*

#### Guild hall

The owner of the occupied guild hall earns, at game end, an additional 1 VP for each small production building (occupied or unoccupied) in their city (= small indigo plant and small sugar mill), and an additional 2 VP for each large production building (occupied or unoccupied) in their city (= indigo plant, sugar mill, tobacco storage, and coffee roaster).

***Example:** at game end, the owner of the occupied guild hall also has a small and large sugar mill, a small indigo plant, and a coffee roaster in her city: she earns an additional 6 VP.*

#### Residence

The owner of the occupied residence earns, at game end, additional VP for the plantations and quarries they have placed on their island. For up to nine filled island spaces, they earn 4 VP, for ten filled island spaces, they earn 5 VP, for eleven filled island spaces, they earn 6 VP, and for all twelve spaces filled, they earn 7 VP.

***Example:** at game end, the owner of the occupied residence has filled 10 of his 12 island spaces with plantations and quarries: he earns an additional 5 VP.*

#### Fortress

The owner of the occupied fortress earns, at game end, one additional VP for every three colonists on their player board.

***Example:** at game end, the owner of the occupied fortress has a total of 20 colonists on his plantations, quarries, buildings, and on his windrose: he earns an additional 6 VP.*

#### Customs house

The owner of the occupied customs house earns, at game end, one additional VP for every four VP they acquired during the game. The player should count only their VP chips (and any extra VP recorded on paper after the chip supply was exhausted, but before game end). They do not count VP earned for their buildings at game end.

***Example:** at game end, the owner of the occupied customs house has accumulated 23 VP in VP chips: she earns an additional 5 VP.*

#### City hall

The owner of the occupied city hall earns, at game end, one additional VP for each beige building (occupied or unoccupied) in their city (city hall counts!).

***Example:** at game end, the owner of the occupied city hall also has: hacienda, harbor, office, construction hut, large warehouse, and residence: she earns an additional 7 VP.*

## THE GAME FOR TWO

*All rules for the basic game apply with for the following exceptions:*

### PREPARATION

* **Each player takes 1 player board, 3 doubloons, and 1 plantation tile**  
Start player: indigo plantation (+ governor placard);  
2nd player: corn plantation.
* **Remove three of each of the plantation tiles** (corn, indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, *and quarry*) from the game and return them to the box. Stack the remaining quarry tiles, shuffle and stack the remaining plantation tiles and place 3 face-up next to the quarries *(always one more tile than players)*.
* **For the buildings,** place one of each beige building and two of each of the six different production buildings on the game board.
* **For the VP,** place 65 total VP in the two denominations as a supply.
* **For the colonists,** place 40 as a supply and place two additional on the colonist ship *(the minimum for two players)*.
* **For the cargo ships,** place the 4 & 6 space **cargo ships** next to the game board.
* **Remove two tokens of each good** from the game, returning them to the box. Place the rest as the goods supply next to the game board.
* **Place the trading house and seven role placards** *(all except **one** prospector)* next to to the game board.

### PLAYING THE GAME

The governor begins and chooses one role placard, which is executed by both players as in the basic game. The players take turns choosing role placards until each has taken *three* and all six of these have been executed as in the basic rules. The governor places 1 doubloon on the remaining (seventh) placard, the players return those they chose, the governor gives the governor placard to the other player and the game continues as in the basic game.

### GAME END

The game ends in the same way as the basic game: at the end of a round in which either there are not enough colonists to fill the colonist ship, the VP chips are exhausted, or a player fills their 12th building space in their city.

## 1st Expansion: THE NEW BUILDINGS

All rules for the original game apply with for the following exceptions:

### PREPARATION

Place all production buildings on the game board as in the original game. Lay out the **55 beige buildings** (2 each of 12 small + 5 large original buildings + 2 each of 12 small + 2 large new (with violet rings) buildings) next to the game board.

**The start player** begins and chooses 1 building from *all* the beige buildings next to the board and places it on the board on an appropriate *(the building cost must match!)* empty beige building space. When a player chooses a small building, they place the second building of the same kind on top of the one just placed: the small buildings are placed in pairs! *(except in a two player game)* The players continue placing buildings in clockwise order until the spaces for all 12 small and all 5 large beige buildings are filled. Place the 26 (2 each 12 small and 2 large) unchosen beige buildings back in the box – they will not be used in the game.

**Please Note:** for the buildings that cost 2, 5, and 8 doubloons, the players will choose two *different* from the *four* available for each cost.

**The game is now played as in the original game...**

#### Aqueduct

If the owner of an occupied aqueduct produces at least 1 indigo in their large indigo plant *(not small)*, they take 1 additional indigo. Similarly, if they produce at least 1 sugar in their large sugar mill *(not small)*, they take 1 additional sugar.

***Note:** the aqueduct has no effect on the small indigo plant or the small sugar mill.*

***Example:** Natalie produces 1 indigo in her large indigo plant and 3 sugar in her large sugar mill: she takes 2 indigo and 4 sugar.*

#### Forest house

On their turn in the settler phase, the owner of an occupied forest house may place a forest on one of their empty island spaces instead of choosing one of the available plantations (or quarry, if that was an option). To do so, they take one of the forest tiles and place it face-up on an empty island space on their player board. When a player builds a building (whether the forest house is occupied or not), the player may reduce the cost of the building by 1 doubloon for each two forests on their island. This reduction is in addition to the builder and quarry reductions, but does not come with the column restriction of the quarry.

***Note:** forests do not have space (or need) for colonists.*

***Example:** Anna has 6 forests, 2 occupied quarries, and is the builder; to build a large warehouse, she pays nothing: 6 –1 (builder) –2 (quarries) – 3 (forests – no column limit) = 0.*

***Note:** if the owner of an occupied forest house also has...*  
*...an occupied hacienda, they may look at a face-down tile before deciding to take a forest or the face-down tile; if the player chooses the forest, they return the facedown tile to the stack*  
*...an occupied library, they can choose freely to place no, one, or both plantation tiles as forests;*  
*...an occupied hospice and places a forest, they place the colonist on their windrose.*

*Once placed on the player board, a player may not change a plantation to a forest or vice-versa.*

#### Black market

When the owner of an occupied black market builds a building, they may reduce the cost of the building by up to 3 doubloons by returning one colonist, one good, and/or one VP to the supply.

***Note:** the player may choose which, if any, to return, but no more than one of each. Also, they may not have any doubloons left after building. Thus, they may only use the black market proceeds to build the building.*

#### Storehouse

At the end of each captain phase, the owner of an occupied storehouse may, in addition to the *one* good they are normally allowed to keep, keep three additional goods of any kinds.

#### Guest house

In the mayor phase, the owner of a guest house may place up to two colonists in their guest house. The player may later move these guests, *at the start, during, or at the end* of all other phases to any building, plantation, or quarry of their choice where they immediately go to work and must remain until the next mayor phase.

The guests may be moved in the same or in different phases.

***Example:** at the end of the captain phase, Anna has an occupied guesthouse and moves one guest to her storehouse and uses the storehouse immediately to keep 3 additional goods that remained on her windrose. Later, she chooses the trader as her role and moves the second guest to her library so she can double her trader privilege. These two guests, like normal colonists, remain on the storehouse and library until the next mayor phase.*

#### Trading post

During the trader phase, the owner of an occupied trading post may choose whether to sell one good to the trading house or their trading post. If they choose to sell a good to their trading post, they may sell any good they have (even one already in the trading house) for the normal price, adding the bonus for the trader, if they are the trader. They place the sold good directly in the supply.

***Note:** the markets do not add their bonuses when a player sells to their trading post!*

#### Church

When the owner of an occupied church builds a building from the 2nd or 3rd columns, they take 1 VP chip; and from the 4th column, they get 2 VP chips.

***Note:** a player gets no VP for building the church itself.*

#### Small wharf

A player with an occupied small wharf may ship different goods during one of their turns during the captain phase, but the player gets only 1 VP for every two goods tokens shipped, returning the goods to the goods supply. Also, the player may ship as few (at least 1) or as many as they like, and need not ship all of a kind.

***Note:** a player may own and use both a wharf and small wharf in the same captain phase.*

#### Lighthouse

Each time, during the captain phase, owners of an occupied lighthouse load goods on a cargo ship, they receive a doubloon. If the owner of an occupied lighthouse is also the captain, they get one additional doubloon.

***Note:** if the captain has an occupied lighthouse, they take 1 doubloon whether they ship or not.*

#### Specialty factory

The specialty factory is similar to the factory, but it rewards production of one kind of goods. The player takes doubloons from the bank equal to 1 less than the number of goods they produced of one kind: the kind they produced the most of *(except corn)*.

***Example:** the owner of an occupied specialty factory produces 4 corn, 3 sugar, and 2 coffee. Thus, the specialty factory earns them 2 doubloons: 3 (sugar) –1.*

#### Library

Owners of an occupied library double the privilege they get when they take a role. The settler may first take either a plantation or a quarry. Then, after all other players have chosen their plantations, the settler may take a plantation from those remaining face up. They may not take a quarry as their doubled privilege.

The craftsman may take two *different* goods.

***Note:** owners of an occupied hospice may only take the extra colonist for the first tile taken; owners of an occupied construction hut may use it for both builds.*

#### Union hall

Before the owners of an occupied union hall ship for the first time in the captain phase, they take 1 VP chip for every 2 of the same good on their windrose. Afterwards, the shipping continues as normal.

***Example 1:** the owner of an occupied union hall has 3 corn, 2 indigo, and 1 coffee on their windrose. They take 2 VP chips: 1 for the corn and 1 for the indigo.*

***Example 2:** the owner of an occupied union hall has 4 corn, and 2 coffee on their windrose. They take 3 VP chips: 2 for the corn and 1 for the coffee.*

#### Statue

No colonists can be placed on the statue. The statue is worth 8 VP at game end.

#### Cloister

The owner of an occupied cloister earns extra VP for sets of 3 like island tiles. For 1 set of 3 like tiles, they earn 1 VP, for 2 sets of 3 like tiles, they earn 3 VP, for 3 sets of 3 like tiles, they earn 6 VP, and for 4 sets of 3 like tiles, they earns 10 VP *(the maximum)*.

*Example: Todd has an occupied cloister and 6 forests, 3 quarries, 2 corn plantations, and 1 coffee plantation at game end. He earns 6 extra VP.*

## 2nd Expansion: THE NOBLES

### PREPARATION

**The 7 different new beige buildings and 1 new production building** can be used with the 17 different beige buildings from the basic game and the 14 different beige buildings from Expansion 1. Place these buildings on the game board on the spaces for them. Place the 20 nobles next to the colonist supply.

**With this expansion, exhausting the colonist supply does not signal the end of the game** *(and neither does exhausting the noble supply)*. Thus, players may use all the colonists in every game. At the beginning of the game and at the end of each mayor phase, place one noble on the colonist ship instead of one of the colonists that were to be placed there *(as long as there are nobles in the supply)*. Nobles can be taken from the colonist ship in the mayor phases (usually by the mayor) instead of a colonist. **Each noble is worth 1 VP at the end of the game.** Players can place nobles anywhere and anytime they would place colonists and they act just as colonists for occupying buildings. A noble is the same as a colonist, except as noted for some of the new buildings described below. When a building suggests a different result for nobles and colonists, it is just that. A colonist cannot get the noble result and a noble cannot get the colonist result.

#### Land office

In the ***trader phase***, the owners of a colonist-occupied land office may buy the top-most plantation tile from a face-down supply stack by paying 1 doubloon to the bank. The player places the tile on their island. In the ***trader phase***, the owners of a noble-occupied land office may discard a plantation tile from their island to take 1 doubloon from the bank.

***Note:** if the owner of an occupied land office also has an occupied forest house, they may choose to buy (or sell) a forest to place on (or discard from) their island instead of the plantation. If the returned tile is occupied, the player places the colonist/noble from the tile on their windrose.*

#### Chapel

In each ***craftsman phase***, the owner of a colonist-occupied chapel takes 1 doubloon from the bank and the owner of a noble-occupied chapel takes 1 VP from the supply.

#### Hunting lodge

At the end of each ***settler phase***, the owners of a colonist-occupied hunting lodge can discard a plantation tile from their island and the owners of a *noble-occupied* hunting lodge can take 2 VP, if they have the most empty island spaces.

***Note:** if players tie with the most empty island spaces, they do not get the 2 VP. If the returned plantation tile is occupied, the player places the colonist/noble from the tile on their windrose. In this case, forests count as plantations, and can also be removed.*

#### Zoning office

The owner of a colonist-occupied zoning office pays 1 less doubloon, when building a small building (columns 1-3) and the owner of a noble-occupied zoning office pays 2 less doubloons when building a large building (column 4).

***Note:** a colonist-occupied zoning office cannot save a player anything when building a large building and a noble-occupied zoning office cannot save a player anything on a small building.*

#### Royal supplier

On their first turn to ship goods in the ***captain phase*** (before they ship anything), the owners of an occupied royal supplier (colonist or noble) may supply the royal warehouse (the supply) with a number of goods from their windrose up to the number of nobles on their island and take 1 VP for each good supplied.

***Note:** such supplied goods must all be of different kinds (no duplicates). Regardless of other buildings or abilities, the player may gain no additional bonuses from supplying these goods to the royal warehouse.*

#### Villa

On a player's first turn in the ***mayor phase***, the owner of an occupied villa (colonist or noble) may take 1 noble from the supply (not the ship!) instead of taking a colonist from the supply. If there are no more nobles in the supply, they take a colonist from the supply instead (if there is one).

#### Jeweler

In the ***craftsman phase***, the owner of an occupied jeweler (colonist or noble) takes 1 doubloon from the bank for each noble on their island.

***Note:** the jeweler counts as a large production building (see guild hall).*

#### Royal garden

At game end, the owner of the occupied royal garden scores +1 VP for each noble on their island *(i.e. this player scores 2 VP for each noble on their island, whether they are on a building, a plantation or on their windrose).*
