# Lucky Numbers Rulebook

## Table of Contents

Be the first to complete you garden in ASCENDING ORDER!

## Components

* 4 sets of 20 Clover tiles in 4 colors,numbered from 1 to 20 :
  * Yellow
  * Red
  * Purple
  * Green
* 4 game boards

## Game Idea

Each player tries to be the first to completely fill their garden with clovers.

But they must check that, at any time, **the numbers are arranged in ascending order in every row and column.**

## Game Setup

**Use one complete set of Clover tiles** (= 1 color numbered from 1 to 20) **per player**. With fewer than 4 players, return unused tiles to the game box.

**Shuffle the clovers and place them face-down** in the middle of the table.

**Note: the clovers’ colors are of no significance once the game starts.** These colors are only here to help the game setup.

**Each player takes a game board** and orients it so that the **ladybug is in the lower right hand corner.**

Then, each player draws **4 clovers and places them, face-up, on the four diagonal spaces** marqued with golden edges.

**Note:** They should keep in mind the goal of the game and place the clovers so that low numbers are in the upper left and high numbers are in the lower right. The four marked spaces have no further significance during the play.

## Gameplay

The oldest player begins, and then play proceeds in clockwise direction. On your turn, you must choose **one of the following two options**:

### A) Take a face-down clover

Take a face-down clover from the middle of the table, and place it, face-up, onto your game board (see «The Placement Rules» on the right).

If you can’t or don’t want to place it, leave it, **face-up** in the middle of the table.

### B) Take a face-up clover

Do not reveal another clover. **Instead**, take one of the face-up clovers from the middle of the table and add it to your game board in accordance with the Placement Rules.

This option is not possible unless there is at least one face-up clover in the middle of the table.

## Placement Rules

* You may either add your new clover to an **empty space** on your game board **or exchange** it for a previously-placed clover (and return the exchanged clover to the middle of the table, **face-up**).
* **The number on the clover you place on your board must fit, in ascending order, with all the other numbers in its row and in its column** (but numbers in a row or or column don’t need to follow each other like 7,8,9...).

All numbers in a row from left to right as well as in a column from top to bottom must be in ascending order.

## Game End

**The winner is the first player to fill in every space of his game board** in accordance with the Placement rules.

In rare cases, the game ends after a player has revealed the last clover in the middle of the table and carried out his turn. In that case, the winner is the player wih the fewest empty spaces left on his game board. In the case of a tie there are multiple winners.

## Variant: MICHAEL’S SETUP

If you want to **add a bit of risk-taking** during the setup, use this rule.

Each player draws one clover from the middle of the table and place it face-up onto any one of the four diagonal spaces (marked with golden edges).

Then each player draws another clover and places it onto one of the remaining 3 diagonal spaces left. And so on for a 3rd and and 4th clover to fill in the 4 spaces of the diagonal.

**Please note:** During this setup phase, once a tile has been placed it may not be relocated or exchanged.

## Variant: TOURNAMENT MODE

Players may also agree to play as many games as there are players, to allow each player to be the start player once.

In this case, players record their points at the end of each game:

**The winner scores 2 points, while the other players lose 1 point for each empty space on their boards.**

The player with the most points (or fewest negative points) when all games are completed is the winner. In case of a tie there are multiple winners.
