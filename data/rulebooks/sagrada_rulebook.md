## Overview

You are an artist competing with fellow artists to create the most beautiful stained glass window in the Sagrada Familia. Your glass pieces are represented by dice, which have a color and a shade - indicated by the values on the dice (the lower the value the lighter the shade).

Each round, players will take turns drafting from a pool of dice, placing these dice on their window. Players must place them within the color and shade restrictions on their Window card, and never have adjacent dice of the same color or value.

After 10 rounds, players score points based on public and private objectives — the highest scoring artisan is the winner!

## Player Setup

1. Shuffle the **Private Objective Cards** (Gray die on the back) and give 1 to each player face down. Players may secretly look at this card.
2. Give each player 2 random **Window Pattern Cards** and 1 **Window Frame Player Board**. Each player selects 1 of the 4 Window Patterns to play (front or back), the other card isn’t used. *Note: Windows have varying difficulty from level 3 (easiest) to 6 (hardest) as indicated near the name. Difficult windows give more Favor Tokens*
3. Give each player the number of **Favor Tokens** indicated by the difficulty number on their card.
4. Slide the selected **Window Pattern Card** into the bottom of the **Player Board**.
5. Place a **Score Marker** that matches the color of
each player’s board next to the **Round Track**,
these are used during **End Game Scoring**.

## Game Setup

* Place the **Round Track** near the center of the play area.
* Shuffle all of the **Tool Cards** and place 3 face up in the center of the play area.
* Shuffle all of the **Public Objective cards** (Blue die on the back) and place 3 face up.
* Place all 90 dice in the Dice Bag.
* Randomly select a player to be the Start Player and give them the Dice Bag. One suggested method is whoever most recently visited a cathedral.

*Set aside all remaining Objective, Tool and Window Cards, they are not used during the game.*

*Note: Setup is the same for 2, 3 or 4 players*

## Gameplay

Each game of Sagrada is played over **10 rounds**.

Each round, the Start Player (the player with the Dice Bag) pulls dice out of the Dice Bag at random and rolls them. The number of dice pulled depends on the number of players:

* 2 Players - 5 Dice
* 3 Players - 7 Dice
* 4 Players - 9 Dice

2 per player, plus 1 additional die

Once rolled, these dice form the **Draft Pool**.

Beginning with the Start Player, each player takes a turn in clockwise order. On a player’s turn, they may perform each of the following actions in any order:

* **Select 1 die** from the Draft Pool and place it in an open space on their Window
* **Use 1 Tool Card** by spending Favor Tokens

*Each action is optional — A player may choose to perform both actions, only one action or pass their turn taking no actions.*

Turns proceed **clockwise** with each player taking a turn or passing.

Once the last player has completed their first turn, the round continues in reverse order (**counter-clockwise**). **Beginning with the last player**, each player takes a second turn (selecting a second die from the Draft Pool, etc.)

*Tip: Being the first to use each Tool Card costs the fewest Favor Tokens. However, Tool Card abilities become more useful later in the game as player’s Windows fill with dice.*

### Placing Dice

When placing a die on a **Window**:

* **First die**: Each player’s first die of the game must be
placed on an edge or corner space
* **Every other die** must be **adjacent** to a previously placed die, touching diagonally (different row and column) or orthogonally (same row or column)
* The die must match the color or value restriction of the space. White spaces have no restrictions
*Example - A red space on the window may only be filled by a red die (any value). A space showing a 3 may only be filled by a die showing a 3 (any color)*
* Dice may **never** be placed *orthogonally* adjacent to a die of the same color or the same value. *Example - Two red dice or two dice showing a 3 may not be placed side by side*

Players may choose not to draft a die during their turn.

*Note: Any die may be placed on a white space as long as all the above restrictions are obeyed*

*Tip: Try to avoid placing dice next to a matching space (such as a 2 die next to a 2 space or red die next to a red space) so a future die can still be placed in that space*

## Tool Cards & Favor Tokens

Players may spend Favor Tokens to gain a special ability from 1 Tool Card during their turn:

1. Place **Favor Tokens** on the **Tool Card** — 1 if there aren’t any tokens on the card, otherwise place 2.
2. Use the ability listed on the **Tool Card**

Players may choose not to use a **Tool Card** on their turn.

## End of the Round

All remaining dice are placed on the **Round Track**, covering the number space for the just completed round. If multiple dice remain (due to players skipping a draft action) these do not cover additional number spaces.

The **Dice Bag** is passed clockwise to the next player. This player is now the Start Player — players then begin another round.

If this was the end of the 10th round, it is the end of the game — proceed to End Game Scoring.

## End Game Scoring

The game ends at the end of the 10th round.

1. Clear the dice off the **Round Track** and flip it over to the **Score Track** side.
2. Use each player’s **Score Marker** to track their position on the **Score Track**, flipping the marker if they exceed 50 points.

Each player tallies their Victory Point total, gaining points from:

* **Each Public Objective Card** - Players may gain points from each card multiple times. Row/Column-based objectives only score for completed Rows/Columns (no open spaces).
* **Their Private Objective Card** - Summing the values of their dice of the specified color.
* **Favor Tokens** - 1 Victory Point for each unspent token.
* Players **Lose 1 Victory Point** for each open space on their window.

**The player with the highest Victory Point total is the winner.** Ties are broken by most points from Private Objectives, most remaining Favor Tokens, then finally by reverse player order in the final round.

### Dice Placement Mistakes

If a Player’s Window is ever found to break *any* of the placement restrictions, that player must immediately *remove* dice (of their choice) from their Window until all restrictions are obeyed. These dice are out of play and any resulting open spaces will count against their score as normal.

## Solo Play Rules

When playing Sagrada by yourself, you’re trying to beat a Target Score. The Target Score is the sum of the values from all the dice on the Round Track at the end of the game.

### Setup

Each game is set up as normal with a few small changes:

* **Favor Tokens** are not used.
* 2 **Public Objectives** and 2 **Private Objective** are placed face up.
* Place **Tool Cards** based on the level of difficulty you wish to play, between 1 Tool (**Most Challenging**) and 5 Tools (**Easiest**).

### Gameplay

Each game is played as normal in 10 rounds, with a few small changes:

* Each round, pull 4 dice from the Dice Bag and roll them.
* Take 2 turns, choosing to draft and place a die (as normal) and/or use a **Tool Card**, or pass.

### Tool Cards

**Tool Cards** may be used only once by spending dice from the Draft Pool. To use a **Tool Card** place a die from the Draft Pool that matches the color shown on the top-left of the Tool Card.

*Note: Each Tool Card may only be used once. Both the die spent and the Tool Card are now removed from play.*

### End of the Round

All remaining dice are placed on the **Round Track** as normal, taking care to not change the value of any dice. If no dice remain, use a **Score Marker** as a placeholder.

### End Game Scoring

The game ends after the end of 10th round. Before flipping the **Round Track**, add up the Target Score.

* The Target Score is the sum of the values from all the dice on the Round Track. Dice used to pay for **Tool Cards** are not counted.
* Tally your Victory Point total as normal (selecting only one of the two Private Objectives), however, you lose 3 Victory Points for each open space.
* If your Victory Point total is greater than the Target Score, you win!
