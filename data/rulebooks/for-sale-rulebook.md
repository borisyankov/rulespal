The player who has the most money at the end of the game is declared winner.

## Setting up

* For a 4 player game, remove the first two cards from the game without looking at them.
* Each player receives:
  * 3 players: 28 coins
  * 4 players: 21 coins
  * 5 players: 16 coins
  * 6 players: 14 coins  
*You should keep your coins hidden.*
* The first player is randomly determined.

## Course of the game

A round of **For Sale** is divided into two distinct phases. In the first phase, players buy home cards through their coins. In a second time, they sell these cards for cheques.

### Phase 1: Buying houses.

This phase consists of several bidding rounds and ends when all the house cards have been sold.

At the beginning of each round, draw as many home cards as players and place them face up in the center of the table. The round ends when all these houses were taken by the players. The players play one after the other in the clockwise direction starting with the first player. In turn, a player has two options:

[Bid](#bid) Or [Spend](#spend).

**Example of a purchase round:**

Theo is the first player in this round because he won the strongest house in the previous round.

* Theo starts by proposing a 1-piece auction.
* Marianne plays after him and offers a better 2-piece auction.
* Then it was the turn of Guilaine who outbid by offering 3 pieces.
* The round returns to Theo, who did not say his last word and which outbid 4 pieces (adding 3 pieces to his previous bet).

Marianne prefers to stop there. She takes 1 of her 2 pieces put into play (the other goes back into the box) and takes home 8 which is the smallest available. Guilaine follows her example: she picks up 2 of her 3 pieces and takes home 20.

Theo is the last player in the game, so he spends all of his 4 pieces and takes the last remaining card, the 28.

### Bid

To bid, a player must place in front of him, visible to all, a certain number of pieces. The first player to bid can make an auction of the value of his choice. The following players must bid higher than the last one announced.

If the turn comes back to a player who has already bid, he can increase the value of his bid or pass.

### Spend

When a player passes, they pick up the smaller value home card still available at the center of the table and places it in his hand. Then they take back half of the coins they placed in front of them during bidding (rounded up), the remaining coins are removed from the game. A player who passes is no longer playing for the rest of the round. If you do not have any more coins, you are forced to pass.

### End of the round

As soon as all but one players have passed, the remaining player must remove all the coins from the game in front of him and take the last card from the center of the table.

Then start a new round. The player who took the biggest card of the previous round becomes the first player of the new round.

When all the cards of the house deck are distributed between the players, the purchase phase ends. Then go to the sales phase.

### Phase 2: Sale of houses

During this phase, the players resell the houses acquired during the first phase against cheques.

This phase is also made up of several rounds and ends when all the cheques have been distributed.

**Example of a sales round:**

Theo, Guilaine and Marianne simultaneously choose one of their houses in hand and place it face down on the table. Then they all reveal it together:

* Theo played the strongest House (the 28), so he takes the cheque of bigger available value: 13,000.
* Guilaine comes next with her house 20. She gets the biggest cheque remaining: 12,000.
* Marianne played the lowest card (8) and therefore takes the last cheque, the one at 0.

At the beginning of each round, draw as many cheque cards as players and place them face up to the center of the table. The round ends when all these cheque have been taken by the players.

The players all play simultaneously: each chooses a house card from his hand and the with face hidden in front of him. When all the players have chosen their card, they all reveal it at the same time.

The player who played the highest value home takes the highest cheque in the center of the table, the next one takes the highest remaining cheque, and so on until all the players have taken a cheque.

The players keep the cheques they acquired in front of them, hidden, face down. The houses played are removed from the game.

When all the cheques in the center of the table have been taken, the round ends. Then start a new round in the same way.

## End of the game

The game ends when all the players have sold their homes and therefore all the cheques have been split between the players.

Each player then adds the value of all his cheques and all the coins he has not spent during the purchase phase.

The richest player is declared the winner. In the event of a tie, the one to whom the most coins remain is the same. If there is still a tie, victory is shared.

## Variant:

**This will not be for everyone**

To play with this variant, follow the same rules with the following changes:

* During the setup, remove from the game randomly and without consulting 10 houses and 10 cheques with **3 players**; 3 houses and 3 cheques with **5 players**. With 4 or 6 players, play with all the cards.
* During the purchase phase, reveal one home *less* than the number of players in each round. The player who passes first recovers all his coins but does not receive any home card.
* During the sales phase, reveal as many cheques as players who still have houses in hand.

When a player has played all his houses, he stops playing.

So there will be fewer and fewer cheques revealed as players empty their hand. When there is only one player left to have houses in hand, he can directly take all the remaining cheques from the deck.
