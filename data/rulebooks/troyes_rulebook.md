# Troyes Rulebook

## Table of Contents

*In the year 1200, the foundation is laid for the cathedral of Troyes, but it will not be finished until 400 years later, after innumerable incidents. This game invites you to experience four centuries of history by participating in the development of one of the finest medieval cities ever to make its mark on Western culture. The society of that day was organized into three orders: the nobility, the clergy, and the peasants. The nobility constituted the military force devoted to justice and to protecting the lands. The clergy were the spiritual guides of the community, contributing to maintaining and developing knowledge and culture. The peasants and artisans, in turn, were given very little consideration, although their hard work was essential to the daily life of the entire populace.*

## Concept of the Game

*Troyes is a strategy game in which you represent a rich family from the Champagne region of France, using your influence to recruit and supervise individuals from the 3 prominent domains: military (associated with the color red in every aspect of the game), religious (white), and civil (yellow).*

Each domain offers different benefits: The military allows you to fight with greater efficacy against invasions. The clergy focuses on completion of the cathedral, and education of the peasants and the military. The peasants toil to fill your coffers.

The citizens of the city provide a work force, represented by dice. You use the work force in different ways: to perform various activities supervised by your tradesmen, to build the cathedral, to grapple with unfortunate events, or even to recruit new citizens. Each of these actions requires utilization of a group of 1 to 3 dice.

In your actions, always regard the goals of the famous character that inspires your family. This individual is one of several very influential people whose principles have helped make the city what it is today! In fact, if you can figure out whose principles the other families follow, you can maximize your own fame, because each family will be scrutinized by all of these famous figures.

**The player who has garnered the most fame, in the form of victory points, will win the game!**

## Contents

* **deniers** in denominations of 1 (×24), 5 (×12), and 10 (×4)
* **1 game board**
* **victory point tokens** in denominations
of 1 (×24), 3 (×10), 5 (×10), and 10 (×10)

* **90 cubes** (20 in each player color: natural, blue, green, and orange, plus 10 gray neutral cubes)
* **8 wooden discs** (2 in each player color: natural, blue, green, and orange): 1 Influence marker and 1 District marker for each player
* **1-page appendix** that describes the Activity, Event, and Character cards
* **9 Activity cards** of each type (military: red, religious: white, civil: yellow). The Activity cards are numbered from 1 to 3, indicating the turn they enter the game.
* **16 Event cards**: 8 red, 4 white, 4 yellow
* **6 Character cards**
* **1 Start Player card**
* **4 Player Aid cards**

## Setup

*Place the neutral citizens, the dice, the deniers, and the victory points (VP) near the board, forming the general supply. Each player chooses a color and starts with:*

**1 District marker** that he places on 1 of the 5 gray disc icons on the city square. Each player chooses the district of the city square closest to his position around the table: this district belongs to him.

**5 deniers** (your deniers are visible during the game). 1 Influence marker that he places on space 4 of the influence track.

**4 citizens with 4 players** (5 with 3 players, 6 with 2 players); they form each player’s personal supply (place the remaining citizens in the general supply). Each player has a maximum of 12 citizens at his disposal during the game.

**1 randomly selected Character card, which he keeps secret** (2 Character cards with 2 players).

* **20 cubes** (the number of cubes is unlimited; if a player runs out, he can use something else to supplement his cubes).

**Sort the Activity cards by color and by the round number during which they enter the game** (the number on the back of the cards). For each color, without looking at the cards, place face-down: a 1 card on the first space of the appropriate color, a 2 card on the second space, and then a 3 card on the third. Return the unused cards to the game box (do not look at them).

**Form 3 decks of Event cards:** 1 red, 1 white, and 1 yellow. The number of Event cards in the red deck determines the number of turns in the game: for 4 players, place 6 cards in it (5 for 3 players, 4 for 2 players). Return the unused cards to the box. The player who last read a history book receives the start player card.

## Initial Placement

*This initial placement only happens once, at the beginning of the game.*

**Each player places the citizens from his personal supply on the 3 principal buildings on the game board (Palace, Bishopric, and City Hall).** To place a citizen, simply put it on an empty space in 1 of the 3 buildings. Once a citizen is placed, it is not moved again during the initial placement.

The 1st round of placement starts with the start player, and ends with the last player, going clockwise. The 2nd round of placement starts with the last player, and ends with the start player, going counterclockwise. The subsequent placement rounds continue in that alternating fashion until each player has placed all the citizens from his personal supply. At the end of the initial placement, the gray neutral citizens are placed on each remaining empty building place (except in a 2-player game, in which the neutral citizens are placed at the beginning of the phase, as illustrated at the bottom of the page).

## Gameplay

*A game lasts 6 rounds with 4 players (5 rounds with 3 players, 4 rounds with 2 players). The first 3 rounds each comprise 6 phases. Thereafter, each turn comprises 5 phases:*

### Phase 0: Reveal Activity Cards

**In the first 3 rounds, for each color, reveal the Activity card color whose number corresponds to the current round: thus 1 new Activity card of each color becomes available in each of the first 3 rounds.**

### Phase 1: Income and Salaries

**Each player gains a fixed income of 10 deniers. Then, he pays the salaries of his citizens in the Bishopric (1 denier per citizen) and in the Palace (2 deniers per citizen). The citizens in City Hall cost nothing.** If he cannot pay the salaries for all his citizens, he pays what he can, then loses 2VP (a player with no VP loses nothing).

### Phase 2: Assemble Workforce

**Each player rolls the dice to which he is entitled: 1 yellow die per citizen located in City Hall, 1 white die per citizen located in the Bishopric, 1 red die per citizen located in the Palace.** Each player then gathers his dice on his district of the city square, being careful to maintain the face-up values that he rolled. Next, the start player rolls the dice associated with the gray citizens placed on the 3 buildings, and places them on a district of the city square not belonging to any player (the gray district). The dice represent the workforce of the citizens of the city, and they enable the players to perform their actions.

### Phase 3: Events

**Each turn, 2 new events enter the game. Reveal the top red Event card from the deck and place it in the event queue, to the right of those already threatening the city. That card will call for a second card, either white or yellow, indicated by the symbol on the red card. Place the second card at the end of the event queue.**

The Event cards in the queue take effect from left to right, beginning with Marauding. There are 2 types of events:

* **military events are indicated by black dice**: the start player takes a black die into his hand for each die represented on the cards. These black dice represent the enemies attacking the city.
* **various events whose effects are indicated on the card, and explained in detail in the annex.**

If a player cannot totally resolve an event, he resolves as much as he can, and then loses 2 VP (a player with no VP does not lose anything).

After all events have been resolved, the start player rolls the black dice that have accumulated. The start player must counter the highest-valued black die with 1 or more dice from his district: the total value of the chosen dice must be equal to or greater than the value of the black die. The dice chosen by the player to counter the black die are discarded, along with the black die. Then, the player to the left of the start player must counter the next-highest black die in the same manner, and so on until all the black dice have been countered (as a result, it is possible that the start player will have to contend with several black dice). If a player’s dice do not allow him to beat the black die he’s up against, he discards it without losing a die, but loses 2 VP.

***Important:***

* *When combating black dice, **the value of red dice is doubled**,*
* *A player can use dice of different colors to counter a black die,*
* *A player can counter several black dice at once: the highest-valued die, plus any others he chooses,*
* *A player gains 1 Influence point for each black die he counters,*
* *It is possible to use Influence points before countering black dice (see Influence),*
* *It is not possible to buy other player’s dice to counter black dice.*

***Notes:** The Marauding event is always present; it never leaves play. The cards remain in play until they have been countered by the players. The number of cards threatening the city is not limited: Continue the queue off the board if necessary.*

### Phase 4: Actions

**Beginning with the start player, then going clockwise, each player can either utilize his workforce to perform 1 action or pass.** This round of the game ends once either there are no more dice available, or all the players have passed (see End of the round). Each action requires using a group of 1 to 3 dice of the same color, and those dice come from 1 or more of the city square’s 5 districts. A die coming from the district of another player must be purchased from that player, who cannot refuse the transaction. Pay the bank to use the dice in the gray neutral player’s district. You do not pay to use your own dice. After dice are used, they are discarded to the general supply.

**The cost of a die depends on the number of dice the player is using for his action:**

* if he is using 1 die, it costs him 2 deniers (if it belongs to another player),
* if he is using 2 dice, each die from another player costs him 4 deniers,
* if he is using 3 dice, each die from another player costs him 6 deniers.

The cost of the dice depends on how many dice are required for the action, so it is important to put together the group of dice before paying the different players.

The players must choose 1 of 5 actions, or pass:

1. Activate 1 Activity card from the city
2. Construct the Cathedral
3. Combat the Events
4. Place a citizen on a principal building
5. Use agriculture
6. Pass

#### 1. Activate 1 Activity card from the city

You may use a group of 1 to 3 dice to assign a portion of the workforce to the activity described on 1 of the available Activity cards. The yellow dice allow you to activate a civil card; the white dice, a religious card; and the red dice, a military card. In order to activate an Activity card, a player must possess a tradesman who can direct the citizens’ work. 2 situations can arise:

* **you do not have a tradesman on the card**

You must first hire a tradesman by paying the amount in deniers indicated in the upper-left part of the card. Place a citizen of your color on a free space on the card to act as the tradesman. The citizen must come either from your personal supply (if you do not have any, you must hire one for 2 Influence points - see Influence), or from any location on the board (Activity cards, or the principal buildings, or even expelled citizens lying on a building). Once the tradesman is hired, the player must put together a group of dice to activate the Activity card.

* **you already have a tradesman on the card**

In this case, you neither pay nor place a tradesman on the card: you just immediately put together a group of dice to activate the Activity card.

2 types of Activity cards can be used:

**Cards with an immediate effect:** The effect of the card is applied immediately. The activation cost, in the lower-left corner of the card, determines the color of dice required to activate the card, as well as the number of times the effect can be used (this number is equal to the value of the group of dice, divided by the number under the division bar, rounded down to the nearest whole number).

**Cards with a delayed effect:** These cards can be distinguished from those with an immediate effect by the hourglass icon in the lower-right corner of the card. When you activate this type of card, place the cubes of your color on the card’s illustration. The number of cubes placed is defined by the activation cost. Each cube can be used later in the game during 1 of your actions, but an action can be modified by only 1 cube (2 cubes can never modify the same action). It is not possible to use a cube to counter black dice in the Event phase.

***Notes:***

* *If you do not have a tradesman on the card, and you can’t hire one, then you cannot activate the card.*
* *At the end of the game, the tradesman is worth the VP indicated on his space.*
* *A single player cannot place 2 tradesmen on the same Activity card.*
* *If all the spaces are occupied, a player can place a tradesman on the card’s illustration, but it will not be worth any VP at the end of the game.*
* *If you hire a tradesman, you are required to activate the card at least once.*
* *If a tradesman gets moved to another Activity card, his space is freed up, making it available for the other players. Other citizens already on the card cannot be moved to the newly freed space.*

#### 2. Construct the Cathedral

**You may use a group of 1 to 3 white dice to work on constructing the cathedral. Each die allows you to place 1 cube on the same-numbered construction site of the cathedral.** This construction site is divided into 3 levels: the bottom row corresponds to level 1, the 2nd to level 2, and the 3rd to level 3. For each value, you cannot place a cube on a higher-level space until there is a cube on each lower-level space.

You immediately gain 1VP and 1 Influence point per cube that you place on the spaces numbered 1 to 3, and 1VP and 2 Influence points per cube that you place on the spaces numbered 4 to 6.

#### 3. Combat the Events

You may use a group of 1 to 3 dice to combat the events threatening the city. The activation cost shown on the left side of an Event card defines:

* the type of dice you must use to combat the event,
* the number of cubes that the player may place on the card (this number is equal to the value of the group of dice, divided by the number under the division bar, rounded down to the nearest whole number).

Place each cube on the upper-leftmost empty banner icon on the card. For each cube placed on a card, you immediately gain 1 Influence point. It is impossible to place cubes on multiple cards in a single action without activating certain military Activity cards.

**The number of banners defines the number of cubes required to counter the event (it is impossible to place more cubes than there are banners). Once the event is countered:**

***Note:** When the Marauding event is countered, players gain VP as indicated above, but nobody takes the card. The cubes are removed and the event is available again to receive new cubes in future actions.*

* the player who placed the most cubes gains the larger VP reward (the upper one). In the case of a tie for first place, the tied players divide the VP for 1st and 2nd place (rounded down to the nearest whole number) and any lower-ranked players gain nothing. If a player is the only one with cubes on the card, he gains the total VP of both ranks. The neutral player’s cubes are considered in determining majorities, and the neutral player can deprive players of VP,
* the player who placed the second-most cubes gains the smaller VP reward. In the case of a tie for second place, the tied players divide the VP for 2nd place (rounded down to the nearest whole number),
* the players retrieve their cubes and put them in their personal
supplies,
* the player who placed the most cubes takes the event
card (if it is the neutral player, the card is discarded). In
the case of a tie, the tied player who placed cubes on the
card first wins. The cards can gain you VP at the end of
the game when the characters’ missions are evaluated.

***Note:** If a gap is formed by eliminating an event card, shift any cards right of the gap leftward to fill the gap.*

#### 4. Place a citizen on a principal building (Palace, Bishopric, or City Hall)

**Unlike the other actions, you always use exactly 1 die to place a citizen on 1 of the principal buildings.** You take 1 of your citizens from your personal supply (if you do not have any, you may hire one for 2 Influence points - see Influence) or 1 of yours already on the board, and place it on the principal building corresponding with the color of the die you have chosen. A red die grants access to the Palace; a white die, the Bishopric; and a yellow die, City Hall.

**The value of the die shows the location inside the building where the citizen is placed.** Find the small picture of a die showing the same value that you rolled. Your citizen will go there, as detailed below:

**At City Hall and the Bishopric, the new citizen is placed on the first space of the matching row.** If the row is filled with other citizens, they are shifted 1 space to the right. If that pushes a citizen out the right end of the row, lay the expelled citizen on the illustration of the building (More than 1 player can have a citizen lying on the illustration). In cases where there is an empty space, citizens fill the space as they are moved to the right.

**At the Palace, the new citizen goes on the matching space.** If there was already a citizen there, the old citizen is expelled and laid on the illustration of the Palace.

**Important:** If you already have a citizen lying on a building’s illustration, nobody can expel your citizen from that building; however, you will retrieve your expelled citizens to your personal supply at the end of the round, so this small protection is only good for the current round. This also means that if placing a citizen would expel a color already lying on the building, nobody can place a citizen there.

#### 5. Use agriculture

**The Agriculture activity allows you to gain some money, thanks to the toil of the peasants (a group of 1 to 3 yellow dice).** This activity does not require a tradesman. You gain a number of deniers equal to the total value of the group of dice, divided by 2 (rounded down to the nearest whole number).

#### 6. Pass

**If you do not wish to perform any more actions this round and there are still dice in the city square (in any district), pass and receive 2 deniers, which you place in your district.** During the remainder of this round, you cannot take any more actions, but each time the turn comes around to you, another denier is added to your district.

### Phase 5: End of the Round

The game round ends after a player’s action if:

* all the players have passed (there are deniers in each player’s district) or
* there are no more dice in any of the districts of the city square. The players retrieve the deniers from their districts. Citizens lying on buildings return to their owners’ personal supplies. Unused dice are returned to the general supply. The start player passes the Start Player card to his left-hand neighbor, and the next round begins.

## Influence

***Before countering a black die, or performing an action, you may spend your Influence points in various ways, in addition to your main action:***

* 1 point: you may reroll 1 die from your district (it is forbidden to reroll anyone else’s dice — even the neutral player’s — even after purchasing them),
* 2 points: add a citizen from the general supply to your personal supply,
* 4 points: you may turn over 1 to 3 of the dice of your district (it is forbidden to turn over anyone else’s dice - even the neutral player’s). The chosen dice are turned to show the opposite face, keeping in mind that the sum of 2 opposite sides of a die is always equal to 7. The dice turned over may be of different colors.

**It is possible to perform several of these actions in any order.**

Note: You may never have more than 20 Influence points: any gained beyond that are wasted.

## End of the Game

The game ends at the end of the round during which the final red event card enters the game.

**In addition to the VP tokens gained during the game, each player:**

* gains 1 VP per un-countered event card on which he has a presence (included the Marauding),
* gains the VP indicated on the spaces occupied by his citizens on the Activity cards,
* loses 2 VP for each of the 3 levels of the cathedral on which he has no cubes,
* reveals his Character card. Each Character will evaluate all the families, checking their performance on the character’s mission. For each Character card in the game, each player gains VP according to the Character card’s criteria. Because each character rewards all the players, it is very important to try to figure out which characters the other players have. Similarly, it is important to bluff a bit in order to misdirect the other players. If they cannot figure out your character’s mission, they are going to have a hard time gaining VP by satisfying it!

**The winner is the player with the most VP.**

***Note:** During the game, VP are hidden. In order to maximize suspense during the final tally, for each type of scoring, each player should make piles of 10 VP in front of himself. This also makes it very easy to compare the players’ scores.*

## The King’s Challenge

*The solo variant is played against a neutral player, le Roy. Le Roy plays without money or influence, but he will try anything to win. The rules for solo play are the same as the standard game, except as indicated below.*

### Initial Placement

* Le Roy uses the meeples of 2 colors. The gray meeples are not used.
* Roll 6 dice (2 red, 2 yellow, 2 white); the 3 highest results indicate where le Roy places three meeples, then proceed
to place 2 of your own meeples. Repeat this placement order until all spots are filled (the buildings should contain
12 of le Roy’s meeples, and 6 of the player’s).
NOTE: Equal numbers are resolved as follows: red > yellow > white. The value of the dice is irrelevant; le Roy
will place his meeples on the best places in each building, as shown here (the best place is 1, the worst is 6):
* Shuffle the 6 character cards, and place them on the table, one on top of the other, in such a way that the
bottom part of each card remains visible. The card on top will be the first to be resolved (see below for
rules on resolving character cards).

### Gameplay

* Le Roy and the player will take turns being the Start Player, alternating each round.
* Negative events do not affect le Roy.
* Any event that refers to the neutral player now refers to le Roy (his meeples and cubes).
* Le Roy ranks his dice by value, then by color ( red > yellow > white), as shown below.
* When combating black dice, le Roy uses his strongest available die to eliminate only the highest remaining black
die. Any remaining black dice are passed back to the player.
* For the player’s turn, the game proceeds just like the standard game. If the player chooses to purchase le Roy’s
dice, he pays the appropriate deniers to the bank.
* For le Roy’s turn, roll 2 black dice and combine their value to determine his action for the turn (see the table on
page 2) . The price indicated is the number of dice le Roy spends for the action. IMPORTANT: Le Roy always spends
his best dice, and continues taking turns until all of his dice have been used. If the price exceeds his number of
remaining dice, le Roy still completes the action using all of his remaining dice.

| Result | Action | Price |
|:------:|:------:|:-----:|
| 2 | Le Roy gains 2 VP | 3 dice (1 is purchased from the player) 1 |
| 3 | Le Roy gains 2 VP | 2 dice (1 is purchased from the player) 2 |
| 4 | Le Roy places 1 worker meeple 3 | 1 die |
| 5 | Le Roy resolves the right-most event | X die/dice 4 |
| 6 | Le Roy places 1 tradesman meeple 5 | 1 die |
| 7 | Le Roy places 2 cubes on the cathedral 6 | 2 dice |

**Notes:**

1. Le Roy purchases your best available die for 6 deniers.
2. Le Roy purchases your best available die for 4 deniers. If you have no dice, he uses his own without paying you.
3. Le Roy’s highest die will indicate where (red=Palace, yellow=City Hall, white= Bishopric). Le Roy always expels one of your meeples if possible.
4. LeRoy spends one die for each free banner on the event card.
5. Le Roy places a meeple on the spot worth the most VP. In case of a tie, use the least expensive location. If still tied, the preference order is red > yellow > white.
6. Le Roy places his cubes on the best available spaces of the lowest available row. If there are no spaces left, le Roy instead gains 2 VP.
7. Le Roy and the player immediately receive the points of the character on top of the pile. This character card is then removed from the game. If there are no characters left, le Roy instead gains 1VP. Le Roy does not score for gold and influence.

### End of the Game

Le Roy and the player receive the appropriate number of points for each of the remaining character cards, if applicable.

The player’s final score is calculated by subtracting le Roy’s VP from his own.

* -100 to 0: Your defeat merits no additional comments. You’re beheaded.
* 0 to 5: Wipe that smile from your face. lt’s not terrible, but le Roy will still have your head.
* 6 to 10: An average performance, at best.
* 11 to 15: Not bad, you’re starting to make something of yourself.
* 16 to 20 : You’re making le Roy start to worry. You’re beheaded.
* 20+: Congratulations! Masterful work!

**Card Modifications:**

* **Tax Collector** - Gain 2 deniers for each of le Roy’s citizens on City Hall instead of 1.
* **Tithe** - Take up to 3 yellow dice from le Roy instead of 1. You can still use a maximum of only 3 dice per action.
* **Traveling Builders** - If there is an empty space on the Cathedral, le Roy gains 1 VP.
* **Banquet** - Do not count le Roy’s dice when determining the district with the most red dice. You gain VP even if le Roy has more red dice in a district than you.
