## Board Setup

1. Place the **game board** in the middle of the table. Put the **50/100 point cards** next to the 50 space on the score track.

2. Shuffle the **18 Goal cards** and place them in a facedown pile next to the board.

3. Place the **money** (**40 coins** including 1s, 5s, and 10s) in a general supply next to the board.

4. Place the **goods** (gold, pepper, silk) and **camels** in a **general supply** next to the board. The **larger** pieces count as **three of the smaller ones**. The supply of goods and camels is not limited. In the rare event that the supply runs out, use something else as a substitute.

5. Place the **6 City Bonus markers** on the board spaces whose letters correspond to those on the tiles.

6. Shuffle the **10 outpost bonuses** facedown. Place one outpost bonus, faceup, onto each large city on the board. Return the 3 unused bonuses to the game box.

7. Shuffle the **31 City cards** facedown. Place one card, face up, onto each of the 9 City card spaces on the board. Return the remaining city cards to the game box. They are not needed for the game.

8. Set **the 6 starting contracts** to the side for now. Shuffle the remaining contracts facedown and form 5 piles, each with 6 contracts. You will have 8 left over.

   Take one of the piles and place one contract, faceup, onto each contract space on the board. Place the remaining 4 piles next to the board.

   Take the remaining 8 contracts and form a special pile. Put this pile next to the board as well, somewhat removed from the others.

9. Place the 10 Character tiles, faceup, next to the board.

10. Some characters have special extras: leave the **2 black trading posts**, the **white die**, and **one figure in each color** in the box for now. A summary of the different characters may be found on the supplement.

11. Place the **5 black dice** onto the board, on the space showing a black die. The die values don’t matter.

12. The player who most recently embarked on a voyage around the world is the start player. Give that player the hourglass.

Various game components will be left over and need to be distributed to the players. What each player receives and how it should be arranged is shown on the next page.

## Player Setup

1. Each player chooses a color. Take the corresponding **player board** and place it in front of yourself.

2. Take the **5 dice** in your color and put them onto the marked dice space in the upper right corner of your board.
3. Take the **9 trading posts** in your color and put them onto the marked spaces in the upper left corner of your board.
4. Each player now receives a contract.

   Use the starting contracts previously set aside. Each player chooses one facedown contract, placing it faceup onto one of the two active contract spaces on their player boards.

5. Give each player 2 camels, which they put into their warehouses. Give the starting player 7 coins. The next player in clockwise order gets 8 coins, the next player after that gets 9 coins, and the last player gets 10 coins. Players should keep their money on the table in front of themselves.

6. For your first game, you will need the following 4 characters: Give the starting player *Rashid ad-Din Sinan*, the second player (in clockwise order) *Matteo Polo*, the third player *Berke Khan*, and the fourth player *Mercator ex Tabriz*.

   Once you are familiar with the game you can pick your characters, see TODO. The character abilities are summarized on the summary.

7. Give each player 2 figures in their color. Place one onto the 50-point space of the score track, and the other onto Venezia.

8. Deal each player 2 facedown cards from the Goal card pile. Players should keep their Goal cards secret.

   Once you are familiar with the game you can pick your Goal cards. The Goal cards are presented in the supplement

9. Finally, give each player a player aid. The game can now begin.

## About These Rules

Because of the complexity of the game, we are going to start by explaining the basic gameplay. We will then, step by step, explain individual options or special cases in more detail. So don’t panic if it seems like something is missing... it is coming. Even Marco’s tales didn’t fit on a single page.

### Introduction

Players play as associates of Marco Polo, who traveled with him and in the surrounding areas. Each player tries to collect points by completing contracts and visiting as many lucrative cities as possible. Completed contracts provide more than just victory points, they also offer discounts and the ability to use privileges in the cities you visit. On top of that, they let you reach goals for the end of the game. **At the end of the game, the winner is the player with the most victory points.**

Play proceeds in clockwise order, with each player **acting in turn**. Players roll their dice and use them to occupy action spaces on the board. Players keep taking turns until all of the dice have been used, at which point the round ends. The game lasts a total of 5 rounds, and then ends after a short final **scoring**. A detailed summary of a game round has been provided at the end of the rules on page 16. For now, we will start with a single game turn and then continue with the actions.

## A Game Turn

A turn in this game means choosing at least 1 die from your player board and placing it onto the action space of your choice. You can add your dice to an unoccupied brown or blue action space, or to an already occupied blue action space. You then **immediately** perform the corresponding action.

You **can** also perform 1 or more bonus actions, either **before** or **after** your regular action. This is always up to you. Refer to your player aid for a summary of the possible bonus actions.

As long as you have dice left, you must choose and perform exactly 1 action. Once you are out of dice, you pass automatically. You will not have any more turns this round! Once you have taken your turn, the next player in clockwise order takes a turn. Players keep taking turns until all of their dice have been placed. This ends the round. Next, we will take a look at the game board, followed by the individual actions.

## The Game Board – The various regions and their associated actions.

The following **6 actions** are possible: Take 5 coins, go to the bazaar, seek the Khan’s favor, take a contract,
travel, and City card actions.

The **bonus actions** are: Complete 1 contract, take 3 coins, reroll 1 die, adjust 1 die result by 1, and take 1 black die.

**We will now explain the various regions and their associated actions.**

## The Actions - General.

The following explains what should be kept in mind when performing an action:

* You can only use your own dice, never those of the other players.
* You must use as many dice as are shown on the action space you want to use.
* You can place your dice on **unoccupied** brown or blue spaces, or **occupied** blue spaces. For the time being, we will assume that the action space is always unoccupied.
* If you want to use an **occupied blue action space**, then you must pay coins. If a **brown action space** is already occupied, you are **not allowed** to use it.
* Each player color (blue, yellow, green, red) can only be used once on each action space.
* After you have placed your dice, you **immediately** perform the corresponding action.
* The dice themselves indicate **how many times** you can perform the action, or **how much** the action gets you *(exception: Take 5 coins)*. Apart from a few exceptions, this is always **the lowest die**.
* If you are allowed to perform an action out multiple times or get more from the action, you can always choose to perform the action out fewer times or get less. You must always perform the action at least once.

**Important: How exactly is an action carried out?**

1. Place your dice.
2. Pay the necessary coins, if any.
3. Perform the action.

## Take 5 Coins - No cash, no options.

To take 5 coins, you must add exactly 1 die to the “**Take 5 coins**” action space.

The **die value you use is irrelevant** and does not affect the action. You always take **5 coins**. If the space is occupied, you must first pay to place your die before performing the action.

## The Grand Bazaar - Goods are useful for many contracts.

Above all else, you will need goods to complete contracts. Additionally, you can use certain City cards, located in the larger cities, to trade goods in for coins, camels, or points. Goods may also bring you points during final scoring.

Sequence:

1. Place your dice on 1 of the 4 distinct action spaces.
2. Determine how many goods you receive.
3. Take the goods and add them to your player board.

### 1. Place your dice on 1 of the 4 distinct action spaces.

You must use as many dice as indicated by the action space you are using.

### 2. Determine how many goods your receive.

To the right of the action spaces is a table indicating how many goods a player receives. **The value of the lowest numbered die** used to perform the action determines how many goods you will receive.

### 3. Take the goods and add them to your player board.

Take the goods from the general supply and place them in your player board’s **warehouse**.

You can also choose to use a value lower than your lowest die value. This usually only makes sense when this gives you some variety in what you receive.

## The Camels - Your constant companions.

You will need camels to complete certain contracts, to be able to move along certain routes, to adjust die results, and to claim black dice. Some of the City cards in the large cities also require camels.

You receive camels in the same way as goods:

Take as many camels from the general supply as indicated by your die’s value. Add the camels to your **warehouse**.

**Note:** There is not much point in using a lower value when taking camels.

## The Khan's Favor - Another way to get the goods.

Place exactly **1 die** onto the « **Khan’s Favor** » action space. Then take **1 good** of your choice and **2 camels** from the general supply, adding them to your warehouse.

### Special rules

The first player to seek the Khan’s favor places her die onto the left-most die-space and claims her reward. The next player who wishes to use this action must place his die on the next die-space over. The next die to be used must have a value **equal to or greater** than the previously-placed die, or the action may not be used. These same rules are in effect for the remaining players.

**Note:** There are only 4 distinct spaces in this action space. When those 4 spaces are occupied, it is no longer possible to choose this action for the rest of the round. Each player color can only be used once on this action space.

## The Contracts - The reason we go to the bazaar.

To take contracts, you must place exactly **1 die** onto the “Contracts” action space. You can then take 1 or 2 contracts from the contract spaces on the board, placing them onto the spaces for active contracts on your player board.

**The value of the die you use here determines the contract(s) you may choose from.**

If you take the contract below the 5, you also receive an additional 1 coin or 1 camel from the general supply. If you take the contract below the 6, you receive 2 coins or 2 camels.

What else needs to be observed?

* Immediately after taking your contracts, slide the remaining ones on the board to the left, filling in any gaps left from the contracts you took. There should never be empty spaces **between** contracts.
  *As soon as you have taken your contracts, slide all remaining contracts to the left.*
* If there is only 1 contract on the contract spaces, you can only take that one during your turn.
* If all contract spaces are empty at the beginning of your turn (before you take any action), draw two contracts from the special contracts pile and place them beneath contract spaces 1 and 2.
* There is room on your player board for 2 contracts. When you take new contracts, you must also have room for them–or you will need to make some. If you do not have enough space, you must discard one or both of your ‘older’ contracts first, adding them to the bottom of the special contract pile.

### Special rules

These are only relevant in special cases and can be reviewed in detail later.

* You are not allowed to take contracts from the board and add them directly to the special pile. New contracts must always be added to your player board first.
* As long as your contracts are on your active contract spaces, they are not worth anything. You must first complete them.

## Travel – Moving your figure around the map.

Place exactly **2 dice** onto the “**Travel**” action space. This allows you to move your figure around the map. The steps involved in moving your figure are outlined below.

### How exactly do you move?

You need to complete the following steps:

1. Place your dice.
2. Pay your travel costs.
3. Pay any additional costs.
4. Move your figure and possibly place a trading post.

#### 1. Place your dice.

The value of the **lowest numbered** die used to perform the action determines how many spaces you can move.

**Note:** You can always choose to move fewer spaces but you must move at least 1 space.

#### 2. Pay your travel costs.

Each “**Travel**” action spaces shows the costs for movement. This means that you **must** always pay for your movement. You only pay for the spaces you actually moved. Return your payment to the general supply.

#### 3. Pay any additional costs.

Many of the routes connecting two locations show additional costs, either camels or coins. In these cases, you must **additionally** pay those costs for your movement, returning the necessary camels or coins to the general supply.

#### 4. Move your figure and possibly place a trading post.

Move from location to location. You will encounter oases, small cities, and large cities in your travels, and you must end your movement in one of these. **You may not stop** between two locations.

* If your “Travel” action ends in a large city, then you **must** place a trading post there. From your next turn on, you can use a die to activate the City card located there. The card itself remains in the city.
* If your “Travel” action ends in a small city, then you **must** place a trading post there. You immediately receive the indicated bonus (see supplement). The tile itself remains in the city. At the start of each subsequent round, you receive the indicated bonus again.
* If your “Travel” ends in an oasis, nothing happens. Oases have no function other than slowing down travel.

### What else needs to be observed?

* When placing trading posts, start with the one in the upper left corner of your player board and continue working your way down and to the right.
* Once you place your 8th trading post, you immediately receive 5 victory points, which are immediately scored on the score track. Once you place your 9th trading post, you immediately score another 10 victory points.
* If you end your movement in Beijing, you place a trading post in the city as usual. Place it on the empty space showing the largest number of victory points. You will score these points at the end of the game.
* Moving back and forth is allowed. This means that you can pass through or end your movement on the same location multiple times.

  **Note:** You may never have more than 1 trading post in any large or small city. You may not place another trading post, even when visiting a city for the second time.

* The “Travel” action determines the start player for the next round.

### What is the outpost bonus?

The **first player** to place a **trading post** in a **large city** receives the outpost bonus for that city. Take the indicated bonus from the general supply and add it your holdings. Return the outpost bonus tile to the game box, it is no longer needed for the rest of the game.

### Special rules

These can be reviewed in detail later.

* At the start of the game, all players start in Venice. It can occur during play that you move your figure back to Venice. If this happens, **you do not place a trading post there**.
* Once you have placed all of your trading posts onto the board, the next time you must place a trading post, you must instead **move an existing trading post** from one location to the other.

## The City Cards – So many possibilities.

Each large city on the board has 1 City card in it. To use a City card, you must have a trading post in the corresponding city. You must then place exactly 1 die onto the City card’s action space to be able to perform the action. The individual city actions are summarized in the supplement.

**Note:** City cards can only be used once per round. Once a player has occupied a City card space with a die, then no one else may use the action until the start of the next round.

**Note:** In most cases, the value of the die you use determines the number of times you may use these actions.

## Bonus Actions – Always freely chosen.

As long as it is your turn, you can choose to perform one or more bonus actions before or after your main action.

What bonus actions are available?

1. Complete 1 contract
2. Take 3 coins
3. Reroll 1 die
4. Adjust 1 die result by 1
5. Take 1 black die

### 1. Complete 1 contract

On the left side of each contract you will see the required camels and goods. On the right side of each contract you will see the rewards you get when you complete the contract. An explanation of the symbols can be found on the supplement.

* You can only complete contracts on the active contract spaces of your player board.
* To complete a contract, you must have the necessary goods and camels in your warehouse. Pay **all** of the necessary goods and camels, returning them to the general supply.
* Receive all of the rewards indicated on the right side. These rewards are always a combination of victory points and something else. The symbols are explained on the supplement.
* Finally, put the completed contract facedown into your drawer, in the bottom right corner of your player board.

### 2. Take 3 coins

Place exactly **1 die** onto the money bag on the game board. Take **3 coins** from the general supply.

Furthermore:

* This space has **no cost**, whether it is occupied or not.
* The die value used when performing this action does not matter. Regardless of the number on the die you place there, you always take **3 coins**.
* As long as you have any dice left, you can continue to choose to perform the “Take 3 coins” bonus action.

**Note:** It is possible to place your last die on this action space, even if this is not a main action.

### 3. Reroll 1 die

You can pay **1 camel** to **reroll 1 of your dice** once.

### 4. Adjust 1 die result by 1

You can pay **2 camels** to **adjust one of your die results up or down by 1**.

**Note:** You may not adjust a 6 to a 1 or vice versa.

### 5. Take 1 black die

You can pay **3 camels** to take **1 black die** from the general supply. Roll it immediately and add it to the remaining dice on your player board.

The black dice are limited. However, all black dice are returned to the board at the end of each round. Consequently, players will have a chance to get more black dice during the following round.

**Note:** Each player can only take 1 black die per turn with this bonus action.

### What else needs to be observed?

* A player may realize a single bonus action multiple times during his turn *(exception: take 1 black die)*. However, the cost must be paid each time. *For example, if a player wants to adjust 1 die twice, he would have to pay 4 camels.*
* You can only perform bonus actions **before or after** your main action.
* If a player has black and/or white dice, he may reroll and/or adjust them.

## Additional Points – What else needs to be considered?

There are a few other things to remember. These are explained below.

### Can you choose an already occupied action space?

Yes, in general action spaces can be occupied by multiple players. All players are allowed to use an action space (except for City cards, see page11). When doing so note the following:

* When you want to use an already-occupied action space, you must pay for it. You must pay as many coins as the die value of the lowest-value die you are using to perform the action. This is independent of any dice already present on the action space. The die values of other players’ dice do not matter. Once you have paid, then you can perform the action as usual.
* When a player wishes to place dice on an occupied space, stack them one on top of the other. This will make it easier to see who is the last player to have chosen that action. If need be (too many dice), place them next to one another, from left to right. The one to the right will now be the last one to have chosen this action.
  Exception: The Khan’s Favor, seen on page 7, only offers four action spaces. When those four spaces are occupied, it is no longer possible to choose this action for the rest of the round.
* White and black dice are not considered player colors (blue, yellow, green, red). As such, a player with those types of dice could reuse an action space they have already used with their player color.
* A player may combine black and white dice with dice of their color. However, your color dice may never be more than once on the same action space *(exception: Take 3 coins).*

**Note:** There is no limit to how many white or black dice can be on an action space.

### Compensation for low die rolls

If the sum total of all of your dice at the start of a round is less than 15, then you receive compensation in the form of coins or camels. You can take 1 coin or 1 camel for each point of difference between your total and 15. You are allowed to take a combination of both should you be able to take more than 1.

## Game End and Final Scoring

### Game End

The game is over after 5 rounds. You can tell how many rounds are left by how many contract piles are left. The final round of the game happens after the last pile of contracts is added to the board. Final scoring occurs after the final round.

### Final Scoring

During final scoring, players score victory points for various items:

* Each player scores the points for their **2 Goal cards**. Goal cards are described in the supplement.
* Score **1 victory point** for every 10 coins you have left.
* If you have a trading post in Beijing you score the victory points indicated by the space your trading post is on.
* If you have a trading post in Beijing, you score 1 victory point for every 2 goods you have left. Players without a trading post in Beijing score nothing for their remaining goods.
**Important: Camels are not goods!**
* The player(s) with the most completed contracts score 7 victory points.

**The player with the most points is the winner.**

### Tie Game

If there is a tie, then the winner is the tied player with the most camels. If there is still a tie, then there are multiple winners.

## The Game with 2 or 3 Players

When playing with 2 or 3 players, apply the following changes:

Only use a number of **black dice** equal to the **number of players + 1**. As such, with 3 players, there will be 4 black dice, and with 2 players, 3 black dice

### 3 players

At the beginning of the game, place **one die (on 1)** from an unused player color on the first space of the “Khan’s Favor” action.

**Important:** This die will stay in place for the whole game! Do not remove it from the board.

### 2 players

At the beginning of the game, place **two dice (each on 1)** from an unused player color on the first two spaces of the “Khan’s Favor” action. Additionally, place **one die (here, the value is unimportant)** on the “Take 5 coins” action space.

**Important:** These dice will stay in place for the whole game! **Do not remove them from the board.**

## The Expert Variant

There are a few small changes to the game in the expert variant. All of the regular rules remain in effect.

You can choose one or more of the following distribution methods. However, if you choose to include them one after the other, proceed in the order described below.

### Distribution of City Bonuses

Randomly distribute the city bonuses across the small cities. Ignore the letters A–F while placing the bonus markers.

### Distribution of Characters

During setup, randomly shuffle the 8 different characters. (There are 3 copies of the “Mercator ex Tabriz” in the game). Shuffle in the version you need, according to the number of players.

Next, reveal as many character cards as there are players taking part plus 1. The last player in turn order (the player to the right of the start player) chooses a character first, placing it in front of him or herself. The players then continue by each taking one character card in reverse turn order. Return the remaining character to the box. The individual characters are summarized on the supplement.

### Distribution of Goal Cards

Deal each player 4 Goal cards, facedown, at the start of the game. Each player secretly chooses 2 of them to keep, returning the rest of them to the game box.

The game then begins as usual.

## A Game Round – How exactly does a round of play go?

At the start of a round

### What needs to be done at the start of a round?

1. Choose a new start player. (Except during the first round.)
2. Award city and character bonuses.
3. Retrieve all dice.
4. Roll all dice, possible compensation.

#### 1. Choose a new start player

A new start player is determined at the beginning of a new round. The player who last chose the “Travel” action during the previous round is the new start player.

**Hint:** Stack dice on this action. This will allow you to quickly see who is the last player to have played on this action; it will be the one on top of the “Travel” action.

**Exception:** If nobody moved in the previous round, then the current start player remains the start player for the next round.

**Exception:** If the last player to move used white or black dice to do so, then players should make sure to remember which player that was. If you know you are the last player to move and you used black or white dice, then you can take the hourglass right away to avoid confusion.

#### 2. Award city and character bonuses.

* All small cities (with a ! symbol) award bonuses. Each player receives bonuses from each small city in which he or she has a trading post, see supplement.
* All characters (with a ! symbol) award bonuses, see supplement.

#### 3. Retrieve all dice

Retrieve all of your dice from the board, returning them to your player board. Return the **black dice** to their space on the board.

#### 4. Roll all dice, possible compensation

All players roll their dice simultaneously. If you rolled less than 15, you receive compensation.
Once all players have rolled their dice, the new round can begin.

#### A Round

Players take turns, in clockwise direction, starting with the start player. This continues until all players are out of dice.

### How does an individual turn go?

1. Perform bonus actions if desired.
2. Choose and perform 1 action.
3. Perform bonus actions if desired.

#### 1. Perform bonus actions if desired

You can choose to perform bonus actions before your main action. You can perform as many of them as you wish (provided you can pay for them).

#### 2. Choose and perform 1 action.

Choose 1 action and place the necessary dice on the board to perform it. Perform the action immediately.

#### 3. Perform bonus actions if desired

You can choose to perform bonus actions after your main action. You can perform as many of them as you wish (provided you can pay for them).

### At the end of a round

What needs to be done at the end of a round?

1. Clear any remaining contracts.
2. Add new contracts to the board.

#### 1. Clear any remaining contracts

Remove any remaining contracts from the board, adding them to the bottom of the special contracts pile.

#### 2. Add new contracts to the board

Choose one of the contract piles and add 6 new contracts to the board. *(Not needed at the end of the 5th round.)*

## Supplement

### Symbols – What do the various symbols mean?

The various symbols are explained here. Whenever you see the same symbol, it has the same meaning. If you see something you don’t understand, please have a look here.

#### Goods, Camels, Coins, and Victory Points

* **Gold, Silk, Pepper, Camel** - These are the symbols for 1 gold, 1 silk, 1 pepper, and 1 camel.
* **1 Fold/Pepper/Silk, 2 ≠ Gold/Pepper/Silk** -  These symbols represent the wooden pieces in the game. You can choose from the indicated goods (gold, pepper, or silk). There is also a variant allowing you to choose 1 or 2 goods. If you are allowed to choose 2 goods, then they must both be **different**.
* **X Coin, X VP** - These are the symbols for coins and victory points.

#### Other Symbols

**Contract** - Take the **top** contract from the **special pile** and place it, faceup, onto one of your active contract spaces. If both spaces are occupied, then you can choose either discard one of your existing contracts or decline to take the new one. In either case, add the unwanted contract to the bottom of the special pile.

**Move 1** - Move your figure one space on the map. You do not need to pay the basic movement cost, although any additional costs (camels or coins) must still be paid. Place a trading post as usual if your movement ends in a small or large city.

**Note:** If a player cannot benefit from that movement, for example, because he does not have the necessary camels, that movement is lost.

**Hint:** Extra moves may allow you to place multiple trading posts in the same turn. For example, if after traveling, you get an extra move that takes you into another city.

**Black Die** - Take 1 black die from the supply on the board. Roll it immediately and add it to your player board. You can use the die during the current round, after which you must return it to the board. Black dice are limited. If none are available on the board, then you cannot take one.

The exclamation point is a reminder that bonuses are awarded at the beginning of a round. You can find the exclamation point on City Bonus markers as well as on several characters.

#### City Bonus Marker - Special Note

If you have a trading post in the small city with this bonus marker, then you can choose one of the other city bonuses each time bonuses are awarded. You can choose a different bonus each time, and you do not need to have a trading post on the city whose bonus you choose.

#### City Cards - Special Note

**Note:** When using a City card to move more than once with the same action, you may only place a trading post in the small or large city where you end your movement. You may not place a trading post in any city you move through.

The die values determine what you receive.

You can exchange items, either goods for camels (or vice versa) or victory points for coins (or vice versa).

**Contract + checkmark** - This means that the completed contracts (i.e. in your drawer) are taken into account. You do not have to pay anything.

**Note:** The die value determines how many contracts are scored. If you have completed more contracts than the number on your die, then you only count as many as the die value. You may also place a die value higher than the number of completed contracts you have.

**Trading post + checkmark** - This means that the trading posts you have on the board are taken into account. You do not have to pay anything.

**Note:** The die value determines how many trading posts are considered. If you have more trading posts on the board than the number on your die, then you only count as many trading posts as the die value. You are also allowed to use a die value higher than the number of trading posts you have on the board. This is similar to completed contracts . See the previous point for more information.

Choose a small city in which you have a trading post. You receive that city’s bonus. If the player can choose more than one city, that player must then choose **different** cities in which they placed a trading post.

Trade **either** 1 camel for 3 coins **or** 1 coin for 1 camel as many times as the number on the die you used. If you want to carry this action out multiple times, then you must make the same exchange each time.

You receive twice as many coins as the number on the die.

### Goal Cards – What do you get for them?

Each player has **2 Goal cards** for which he or she scores victory points at the end of the game. Each card shows two **specific cities** (both large and small). You need to have trading posts in those cities at the end of the game to score any points.

#### 1. Have a trading post in both indicated cities.

If you have 1 trading post in both of the required cities at the end of the game, then you score the victory points indicated on the right hand side of the Goal card. If you only have a trading post in one of the two, then you score nothing.

Each of a player’s two Goal cards are scored as such.

#### 2. Have trading posts in multiple goal cities.

This is where the table at the bottom of the card becomes important. The table is the same on every Goal card. Since each Goal card shows 2 required cities, and since each player has 2 Goal cards, then it is possible to be in up to 4 different goal cities. Each city is scored that is indicated on at least 1 of your 2 Goal cards. If you only reached 1 of the necessary cities, then you only score 1 victory point. If you reached 2 different cities, then you score 3 victory points, etc.

**Important:** The cities must be different! If the same city is on both of your Goal cards, then it can only be counted once.

### The Characters – What can they do?

**The characters can change the normal rules of the game. Such changes take priority over the normal rules.**

#### Raschid ad-Din Sinan

You do not roll your dice. Whenever you choose an action, you choose the die values yourself.

**Note:** You cannot receive compensation.

**Important:** You must still pay if you want to use an occupied action space. You must also pay any additional costs when traveling (coins or camels).

#### Matteo Polo

You receive the **white die** at the start of each round. Roll it and add it to the remaining dice on your player board. You also receive the topmost **contract** in the special pile at the start of each round.

#### Mercator ex Tabriz

**Note:** There are 3 copies of “Mercator ex Tabriz” in the game. The one you use depends on how many players are taking part. Only use the copy that matches your player count.

**4 players:** Whenever **another player** chooses to go to the bazaar, you receive **one** of the goods that the other player chose. This also counts for camels.

**3 players:** Same as the 4-player version. Additionally, whenever **another player** seeks the Khan’s favor you receive **1 camel**.

**2 players:** Same as the 3-player version. Additionally, whenever **the other player** takes 5 coins, you receive **2 coins**.

***Hint:** The player who has the Mercator ex Tabriz should let the other players know that he is grateful for their gifts and thank them when appropriate.*

#### Kubilai Khan

You place your figure in **Beijing** (not Venezia) at the start of the game. This means that your travels will start from there.

Additionally, place **1 trading post** onto the 10 victory point space in **Beijing**.

#### Berke Khan

You do not have to pay anything to use an occupied action space.

**Note:** This **does not** allow you to use occupied City cards.

#### Niccolo and Marco Polo

You receive another figure with which to move across the map at the start of the game.

Your second figure also starts in Venezia.

You also receive **1 camel** at the start of each round.

**Note:** You are allowed to split your movement between the two figures when traveling. However, you must pay **all travel and additional costs before** moving both figures.

#### William of Rubruck

You receive **2 black trading posts** at the start of the game. Add them to your other trading posts. If you manage to place all **11 of your trading posts** by the end of the game, you score an additional **10 victory points**.

You also **place trading posts in any city**, large or small, that you **move through** while traveling. This means that you do not need to end your movement in a city to place a trading post there. However, you will only receive the bonuses from trading posts, if any, **after ending your movement**.

**Note:** You are allowed to move back and forth over a city, even one that you have already visited. You may still only have 1 trading post in each city.

#### Johannes Carpini

You can move from one oasis on the map to another during movement.

Whenever you choose to travel, you are allowed to move from one oasis to another.

This counts as one move. You can start your travel on the oasis, or first move to an oasis from a city and then move to another oasis afterward. You are allowed to keep moving to another city afterward. You are only allowed to move if you have paid for the necessary spaces. You also receive **3 coins** at the start of each round.
