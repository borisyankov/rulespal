### First time playing Teotihuacan?

If it is your first time playing Teotihuacan, we strongly recommend that you use the Action Boards pre-printed on the Main Board. Simply place the Main Board in the middle of the table and jump straight to step 6 below. Return all Action Boards, Royal tiles, Technology tiles, and Temple Bonus tiles back to the game box without placing any of them on the Main Board. Also, when conducting player setup, follow point 6 of the Player setup section below.

## SETUP

### Board setup

1. Place the Main Board in the middle of the table.
2. Shuffle the Action Boards numbered 2 to 7 and lay them out face up into spaces 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (covering up the printed Action Boards). Action Boards 1 and 8 are never covered by other Action Boards.
3. There are three categories of Royal tiles, marked with an A, B, or C in the top-left corner of the tiles. Randomly select 3 Royal tiles, one from each category, and place them face up on the indicated spots of the Palace (1) Action Board.
4. Randomly draw 6 Technology tiles and order them by the reference numbers printed in the top-right corner of the tiles. Place these tiles face up on the Alchemy (5) Action Board in ascending order, from left to right, beginning with the top row.
5. Randomly select 3 Temple Bonus tiles and place one on each temple’s penultimate step.
6. Place the light Calendar disc on space 0 of the Calendar track. Place the dark Calendar disc on the Calendar track based on the player count:
   * For 4 players: place on space 12.
   * For 3 players: place on space 11.
   * For 2 players: place on space 10.
7. Place a wooden Building on each space of the Buildings row on the Main Board, excluding the leftmost space.
8. Shuffle all Decoration tiles and place them in a face-down pile on the Decorations (7) Action Board, then draw 4 Decoration tiles and place them face up on the indicated spaces of the Action Board.
9. Shuffle all Pyramid tiles and place them in several face-down piles next to the Construction (8) Action Board, then draw 3 Pyramid tiles and place them face up on the indicated spaces of the Action Board.
10. Next, draw Pyramid tiles randomly and place them on the Pyramid grid, to form the patterns in the physical rulebook.
11. Shuffle all Discovery tiles and place them in several face-down piles next to the Main Board.
12. Draw 5 Discovery tiles and place them face up on the spaces near the Worship actions on the following Action Boards: Palace (1), Forest (2), Stone Quarry (3), Gold Deposits (4), Decorations (7).
13. Draw 6 Discovery tiles and place them face up on the spaces along the Avenue of the Dead: 3 on the first spot, 2 on the second, 1 on the third.
14. Draw more Discovery tiles and place them face up on the major steps of the temples, as indicated by the numbers on them: place a number of tiles equal to the first number for 2 players, second number for 3 players, and third number for 4 players.

### Player setup

1. Give each player a player colour token of their choosing. Each player will use the workers (dice) of that colour.
2. Randomly determine the first player. Give that player 1 cocoa and the “1” Player Order token.
3. Give the player sitting to the right (anticlockwise) of the first player 3 cocoa, and a Player Order token with a value equal to the number of players (“2” for a 2-player game, “3” for a 3-player game, “4” for a 4-player game). This token will from now on be referred to as the Last Player token.
4. Give every other player 2 cocoa, and Player Order tokens reflecting their positions in the player order (with the player sitting to the left of the first player receiving the “2”, etc.).
5. Give each player all 12 coloured discs matching their player colour token. Each player should keep 6 of them to be used as Technology markers. Place the remaining 6 discs on the following locations:
   * The 0 spot of the Pyramid track.
   * The bottom of the Avenue of the Dead track.
   * The bottom step of all 3 temples.
   * The 0 Victory Points space on the score track.
6. IF THIS IS YOUR **FIRST GAME**:
   * Each player places one worker showing a power of 3 onto the Ascension wheel.
   * In addition to starting cocoa, players receive the following resources:
     * Player “1” receives:
       * 5 cocoa,
       * 1 wood,
       * 2 stone,
       * 4 gold,
       * an advance on the green temple (which provides 1 more cocoa).
     * Player “2” receives:
       * 5 cocoa,
       * 4 wood,
       * 1 stone,
       * and a single advance on the red and the blue temples (which gives 1 Victory Point and a stone).
     * *In 3- and 4-player games*: Player “3” receives:
       * An advance on the Avenue of the Dead track,
       * 4 cocoa,
       * 3 wood,
       * 4 stone,
       * an advance on the blue temple (which provides an additional 1 gold).
     * *In 4-player games*: Player “4” receives:
       * 2 wood,
       * 5 gold,
       * an advance on the green temple (which gives 1 more cocoa),
       * a Technology marker on the 3rd lowest numbered Technology tile (which provides another advance on the green temple, which provides another cocoa).
   * The players should place the following starting workers in the general area (see sidebox) of the indicated Action Boards.

   **General Area**

   The rules often refer to the “general area” of an Action Board. When instructed to place a worker (die) there, place it in a way so that it does not cover any imagery.

   Every worker on an Action Board is considered being in the “general area” of the Action Board, EXCEPT workers locked in Worship spaces (detailed later).

     * Player “1”:
       * power of 2 on Nobles (6),
       * power of 1 on Forest (2),
       * power of 1 on Construction (8).
     * Player “2”:
       * power of 2 on Decorations (7),
       * power of 1 on Forest (2),
       * power 1 on Stone Quarry (3).

      **Worker Power Level**

      Some abilities depend on the power of your worker. This is a value between 1 and 5, which is represented by the face value of the worker. If a die ever reaches a power of 6, it immediately Ascends. The process of Ascension is detailed later.

     * *In 3- and 4-player games*: Player “3”:
       * power of 1 on Palace (1),
       * power 1 on Forest (2),
       * power 1 on Decorations (7).
     * *In 4-player games*: Player “4” :
       * power of 1 on Stone Quarry (3),
       * power 1 on Gold Deposits (4),
       * power 1 on Alchemy (5).

7. IF THIS IS **NOT** YOUR FIRST GAME:
   * Each player places 1 worker showing a 3 onto the Ascension wheel, sets the other 3 workers to a starting power of 1, and places them next to their player colour token.
   * Randomly deal 4 Starting tiles to each player. If any player receives Starting tiles with a Discovery icon on it, that player should now draw a random Discovery tile for each such icon.
   * Each player simultaneously picks 2 Starting tiles, returning the other 2.
   * Each player gains all benefits of their chosen tiles:
     * Power-ups increase the starting power of one of their dice.
     * When receiving a Discovery tile, claim the tile by paying its listed cost.
     * When receiving temple advances, gain the benefit of the temple immediately as normal.
     * When receiving a Technology tile, place a marker on the Technology tile with the lowest reference number. No gold is spent, but the temple advance is still rewarded.
   * Finally, each player must place their starting workers onto the general area (see sidebox) of the Action Boards matching 3 unique Action Board numbers on their selected Starting tiles (no 2 dice belonging to the same player may start the game on the same Action Board).
8. In 2- and 3-player games only:
   * In a 3-player game draw 2 Starting tiles and place 3 workers of an unused colour on the first 3 (unique) Action Boards shown on the Starting tiles.
   * In a 2-player game, repeat this process to place 3 workers of the second unused colour.
   * These “neutral” workers count as a different coloured worker for all game purposes.
9. Return all Starting tiles (used and unused) to the game box.
   *All unclaimed Discovery tiles are shuffled back into the Discovery tile stacks.

## RULES OF PLAY

Starting with the first player, each player takes a turn as outlined below, then play proceeds clockwise, continuously. There are no phases and steps in Teotihuacan; each player simply resolves their turns one after another, until an Eclipse (scoring) is triggered (see later).

### Player turns

On your turn you must choose one of the two options:

* Take a normal turn OR
* Unlock all of your locked workers for free (see sidebox).

After performing your chosen option, if you have the Last Player token, advance the light disc on the Calendar track by one. This might trigger an **Eclipse** (see later).

Afterwards, proceed to the next player in clockwise order for their turn.

#### Taking a Normal Turn

If you are taking a normal turn, you must select exactly one of your unlocked (see sidebox) workers and advance it by 1, 2, or 3 Action Boards in a clockwise direction.

After moving the worker, you must perform one of 3 possible actions on the Action Board your worker ends its movement on:

* Collect Cocoa
* Worship
* Perform Main action

**Note:** If you do not have an unlocked worker available, nor are you willing or able to pay to unlock them, you cannot take a normal turn; you must take the free unlock option instead.

##### Workers Locked and Unlocked

Workers can be locked or unlocked. A worker is locked if it is on a space with a thick border and a key inside (they are called Worship spaces).

Workers in the general area of an Action Board are all unlocked.

You may NOT move locked workers, but you may pay 3 cocoa to the supply at any time during a normal turn to unlock all of your locked workers. Alternatively, you may select the “Unlock all of your locked workers for free” option during your turn instead. When unlocking a worker, slide it to the general area of the same Action Board.

**Note:** You may choose to pay 3 cocoa (or spend a full turn to unlock your workers for free) even if not all of your workers are locked.

#### Collect Cocoa

You can take the Collect Cocoa action on any Action Board. Before placing your moved worker in the general area of the Action Board, count the number of different coloured workers already present on the board (disregarding any locked worker in the Worship space). You receive that much cocoa plus 1. Place the moved worker in the general area of the Action Board in question.

#### Worship

The Worship action can only be taken on the following Action Boards:

* Palace (1)
* Forest (2)
* Stone Quarry (3)
* Gold Deposits (4)
* Decorations (7)

The Palace (1) Action Board has 3 Royal tiles with one space each, while the other 4 Action Boards have a temple sidebar, each with one space.

1. Select a Worship space on the Action Board. If there is already a worker belonging to another player on the space, pay 1 cocoa to the general supply, and unlock that worker (move it to the general area of that Action Board). Then place your moved worker in the selected Worship space. You may not unlock your own workers this way!

2. Choose one of the following options:
   * Activate the Worship space ability OR
   * Claim the Discovery tile near the Worship space by paying any costs depicted on the tile OR
   * Pay 1 cocoa to choose both of these options, activated in any order.

   **Note:** Any cocoa costs associated with unlocking another player’s worker, or when choosing both options of a Worship space, must be paid before resolving any benefits associated with the Worship action.

   In case of the Palace (1) Action Board, refer to the Appendix for an explanation of the abilities of each Royal tile.

   In case of the following Action Boards: Forest (2), Stone Quarry (3), and Gold Deposits (4), advance one space on the temple shown (see sidebox on page 11 for advancing on temples).

   In the case of the Decorations (7) Action Board, advance one space on a temple of your choice.

   **EXCEPTION:** When placing your worker on the Palace (1) Action Board, you must choose one of the Royal tiles and activate its ability. You may not choose to only claim the Discovery tile, though you may still pay the additional cost of 1 cocoa to both activate the ability and claim the tile.

3. If you claimed a Discovery tile, draw a new one and place it
face up in the claimed one’s place.

##### Claiming Discovery tile.

You claim a Discovery tile by paying any resources printed in its top-left corner (if no resources are printed, the tile has no cost). You have to pay the cost regardless of how the tile was obtained: from a Worship action or from advancing onto a major step of a temple or the Avenue of the Dead. If you are unable or unwilling to pay, you are not allowed to claim the tile.

After claiming, place the tile face up in front of you. If it is a mask, it will be scored during every remaining Eclipse. Otherwise, you may flip it face down at any time during one of your turns (even immediately after claiming it, although you may keep it for later) to receive the benefit shown. Keep the face-down tiles in front of you, as they might matter during the final Eclipse.

Refer to the Appendix for an explanation of the ability of each tile.

##### Advancing on the temples.

When you advance on one of the three temples, move your marker up by one step.

If it is a minor step, immediately claim the reward shown on the step.

**Note:** The icon means any resource (wood, gold, or stone).

If it is a major step, you may claim one of the Discovery tiles present on the step (if there are any present there) OR claim the reward shown on the step itself.

If it is the penultimate step, nothing happens, you simply qualify for the end-game scoring condition shown on the Temple Bonus tile on that step.

If it is the topmost step, claim the reward shown on the step. You still qualify for the end-game scoring condition.

**Note:** You may only advance onto the topmost step of the temple if no other player has a marker there. If for any reason you cannot advance further, you simply do not advance and do not gain any further benefit.

#### Perform Main action

To perform the Main action of an Action Board, first count the number of different coloured unlocked workers already present on the board (ignoring the arriving worker). You must pay this much cocoa before performing the Main action. If you cannot, you may not take the Main action.

Place the moved worker in the general area of the Action Board in question.

Each Action Board has a different Main action, except the Palace (1), which does not have a Main action.

When counting how many workers you have on the Action Board, for purposes of resolving any of the Main actions, you are always limited to 3. Therefore, even if you happen to have all 4 of your workers on the same Action Board when resolving a Main action, it still counts as having 3 workers. When counting workers for the action’s effects, always include the worker you just placed there.

When taking a Main action, you must always resolve its effects, collecting or paying resources as necessary. You may not forfeit the effects of a Main action just to power up one of your workers.

### Description of the Main actions

#### Palace (1)

The Palace (1) Action Board does NOT have a Main action. When moving a worker here, you may only place it on a Royal tile to take a Worship action or in the general area to take a Collect Cocoa action.

#### Forest (2), Stone Quarry (3), Gold Deposit (4)

Count the number of your unlocked workers in the general area of the Action Board in question (including the worker you just moved) to select a row on the Action Board. Use the power of your lowest value worker to select a column on the Action Board. Gain the rewards (wood, stone, gold, cocoa, Victory Points, or temple advances) shown in the corresponding cell.

Then power up one of your workers on the same Action Board. If you have 3 or more workers on that Action Board, you may power up twice instead (still powering up only workers on the same Action Board).

#### Alchemy (5)

Select one Technology tile on the Alchemy (5) Action Board observing the following restrictions:

1. If you have only one worker on this Action Board, you must select from the first row.
2. If you have two or more workers on this Action Board, you may select from either row.
3. **EXCEPTION:** If you have only one worker on this Action Board but its power is 4 or 5, you may still choose from the second row, but doing this will forfeit the power-up you would gain from this action.

Pay the cost in gold as shown on the selected tile and place one of your Technology markers (wooden discs) on it to mark that you have acquired this Technology. Refer to the Appendix for an explanation of the ongoing benefit of each Technology tile.

Any other player who already had a disc on the tile you develop immediately scores 3 Victory Points. You may never develop a Technology you have previously acquired (you may not place a Technology marker on a Technology tile with one of your markers present).

After placing the Technology marker, advance once on one temple, depending on which column the selected Technology belongs to: for the left column, for the centre column, for the right column.

Afterwards, power up one of your workers on the Alchemy (5) Action Board, unless you used the 3rd option when selecting the tile (you used a single power 4 or 5 worker to place your marker on a second-row Technology).

##### Power up a Worker

When an ability allows you to power up one of your workers, select one of your unlocked workers and rotate the die representing the worker to the side showing a one higher number, to increase its power. If this causes the worker to reach a power of 6, it immediately triggers an Ascension, which will be detailed later in the rules.

If an ability allows you to power up twice, you may power up the same worker twice or two eligible workers once each.

#### Nobles (6)

Pay 2 wood to take the first available Building from the left side of the Buildings row on the Main Board (it is important that these Buildings are always taken from left to right), and place it in the leftmost available space of one of the Building rows of the Nobles (6) Action Board:

* If you have 1 worker on this Action Board: Place the Building in the leftmost empty space of the top row. If there are no empty spaces, you may not take this action.
* If you have 2 workers on this Action Board: Place it in the leftmost empty space of the centre row. If there are no empty spaces on the second row, place it in the row above, if possible.
* If you have 3 workers on this Action Board: Place it in the
leftmost empty space of the bottom row. If there are no empty
spaces on the third row, place it in one of the rows above, if
possible.

Then, score a number of Victory Points equal to the printed value of the space you covered with the Building, and advance your marker one step on the Avenue of the Dead track, to a maximum of 9.

Afterwards, power up one of your workers on the Nobles (6) Action Board. IIf you have 3 or more workers on that Action Board, you may power up twice instead (still powering up only workers on the same Action Board).

#### Decorations (7)

Pay 3 gold to select one of the 4 available Decoration tiles. For each additional worker you have on this Action Board you receive a 1 gold discount to the cost (to a minimum of 1 gold).

Add the selected Decoration tile to the Pyramid using the following restrictions:

* It must be placed in one of the marked spaces.
* You can only place on the spaces marked with a “2” if there is a layer of Pyramid tiles under both of its squares AND there is a Decoration on the nearest space marked “1”.
* You can only place on the spaces marked with a “3” if there are two layers of Pyramid tiles under both of its squares AND there is a Decoration on the nearest space marked “2”.
* You can only place on the spaces marked with a “4” if there are three layers of Pyramid tiles under both of its squares AND there is a Decoration on the nearest space marked “3”.
  * The tile must be placed so that its arrow points towards the centre of the Pyramid.

When placing the tile, check the icons you are covering. For each icon being covered by an icon of the same type on the Decoration tile, score 1 Victory Point.

If you scored 1 Victory Point for an icon that is red, green, or blue on the Decoration tile (the colour of the icon that is being covered does not matter), also advance on the corresponding temple.

Then score an additional 3 Victory Points and advance your marker one step on the Pyramid track.

Afterwards, power up one of your workers on the Decorations (7) Action Board and draw a new Decoration tile to refill the tile offer.

#### Construction (8)

You may select one of the available Pyramid tiles and add it to the Pyramid for each worker you have on the Construction (8) Action Board. You must add at least one tile.

* You can place a Pyramid tile on the first (bottom) level, into one of the empty squares, by paying 2 stone. Score 1 Victory Point for each tile added to the first level.
* You can place a Pyramid tile on the second level, over the intersection of four tiles of the first level, by paying 2 stone and 1 wood. Score 3 Victory Points for each tile added to the second level.
* You can place a Pyramid tile on the third level, over the intersection of four tiles of the second level, by paying 2 stone and 2 wood. Score 5 Victory Points for each tile added to the third level.
* You can place the top tile of the Pyramid (the fourth level) over the intersection of the four tiles that form the third level of the Pyramid, by paying 2 stone and 3 wood. Score 7 Victory Points if you place the top tile. ***Additional effect***: If a tile was placed on the fourth level of the Pyramid, the Pyramid is considered finished. The active player must immediately move the white Calendar disc to the position of the black Calendar disc. This will trigger a final Eclipse, as described in the Eclipse & End of Game section, and end the game.

You may rotate the tile any way you choose. When placing the tile, check the icons you are covering. For each icon being covered by an icon of the same type on the newly placed Pyramid tile, score 1 Victory Point.

If you scored 1 Victory Point for an icon that is red, green, or blue on the newly placed Pyramid tile (the colour of the icon that is being covered does not matter), also advance on the corresponding temple.

Then advance your marker one step on the Pyramid track.

If adding more than one tile to the Pyramid, always fully resolve all effects before adding the next tile, including the scoring of Victory Points, advancement on the Pyramid track, as well as temple advancements, if any.

Afterwards, power up one of your workers on the Construction (8) Action Board. If you have 3 or more workers on that Action Board, you may power up twice instead (still powering up only workers on the same Action Board). Finally, draw new Pyramid tile(s) to refill the offer.

### Ascension

Ascension triggers immediately when a worker reaches power 6 due to a power-up. When that happens, perform all of the following:

* Advance your marker one step on the Avenue of the Dead track (thematically your worker gets a burial along the road), up to a maximum of 9.
* Move the die representing the newly ascended worker to the Palace (1) Action Board (placing it in the general area), and reset it to a power of 1. This is a “new” worker now.
* Select one of the rewards shown on the Ascension wheel:
  * Score 5 Victory Points
  * Gain 5 cocoa
  * Advance your marker one step on one of the temples
  * Pay 3 cocoa to advance your marker twice on temples (either once on two different temples, or twice on the same temple)
  * If you have only 3 workers in play, gain your 4th worker (with a starting power of 3), placing it in the general area of the Palace (1) Action Board. Additionally, gain 2 cocoa.
* Advance the light disc on the Calendar track by one. This might trigger an Eclipse.

**Note:** It is possible for more than 1 of your workers to Ascend on the same turn. If this happens, fully resolve the above procedure for each Ascended worker, but trigger an Eclipse only after you finish your turn, if applicable.

## ECLIPSE & END OF GAME

An Eclipse (a scoring) triggers after the light disc on the Calendar track reaches the space occupied by the dark disc. If any effect would move the light disc beyond the position occupied by the dark disc, stop the movement upon reaching the dark disc, and ignore any further movement.

* If the light disc reached the dark disc space on the Last Player’s turn, play one more full round (each player plays one more turn, including the Last Player), and then proceed to the scoring outlined below.
* If the light disc reached the dark disc space on another player’s turn (not the Last Player’s turn), finish the current round (giving all players an equal number of turns), and then play another full round as described above, before proceeding to scoring.

### Eclipse scoring

During each Eclipse resolve the steps below:

1. Find the lowest visible number on the Buildings row on the Main Board. Each player scores that many Victory Points for each step they have moved up on the Avenue of the Dead.
2. The player (or players) furthest ahead on the Pyramid track scores 4 Victory Points.
3. Each player scores points for each step they have moved up on the Pyramid track:
   * 4 Victory Points if this is the first Eclipse,
   * 3 Victory Points if this is the second Eclipse,
   * 2 Victory Points if this is the third Eclipse.
4. Reset the Pyramid track for all players, by moving all player markers to their starting position. This is the only track which resets after each Eclipse!
5. Each player organizes their masks into one or more sets, where each set is comprised of ***different*** masks. Then **each** set scores points, depending on the number of masks in that set:
   * Each set of 1/2/3/4/5/6/7 masks score 1/3/6/10/15/21/28
Victory Points.
6. Each player must now pay a salary of 1 cocoa per worker, and an additional cocoa for each worker with a power of 4 or 5. For each cocoa a player is unwilling or unable to pay, that player loses 3 Victory Points. If at any time this reduces a player’s Victory Point total to 0, that player loses no more Victory Points.
7. If this is the first or second Eclipse, reset the light disc on the Calendar to its starting position, and adjust the dark disc based on the number of players:
   * 2 players:
     * First Eclipse: set to 9.
     * Second Eclipse: set to 8.
     * Additionally, draw 2 Starting tiles, and move the 3 workers of one of the unused colours onto the first 3 (different) Action Boards shown on the Starting tiles.
     * Repeat this: Draw 2 more Starting tiles, and move the 3 workers of the other unused colour onto the first 3 (different) Action Boards shown on the Starting tiles.
   * 3 players:
     * First Eclipse: set to 10.
     * Second Eclipse: set to 9.
     * Additionally, draw 2 Starting tiles, and move the 3 workers of the unused colour onto the first 3 (different) Action Boards shown on the Starting tiles.
   * 4 players:
     * First Eclipse: set to 11.
     * Second Eclipse set to 10.
8. If this is the third Eclipse, or if this Eclipse was triggered by placing the final Pyramid tile, each player who has qualified for one or more Temple Bonus tiles (by being on the penultimate or topmost step of a temple) scores additional Victory Points based on any Bonus tiles they have reached. Refer to the Appendix for an explanation of all Bonus tiles.

After resolving the third Eclipse (or the Eclipse triggered by placing the final Pyramid tile) the game is over. The player with the most Victory Points is the winner. In case of a tie, the tied player with the most cocoa remaining is the winner. If still tied, the tied player with the lower number on their Player Order token is the winner.

## STARTING TILE DRAFT VARIANT

Once you have played Teotihuacan a few times, you may want to use an alternative method of receiving your Starting tiles. Please note, however, that this variant is recommended only for players with both a solid grasp of the rules and enough experience to be able to form a strategy from the first moments of the game.

Instead of dealing each player 4 Starting tiles, place a number of face-up Starting tiles in the middle of the table. The number depends on the number of players:

* For 2 players: place 6 Starting tiles
* For 3 players: place 8 Starting tiles
* For 4 players: place 10 Starting tiles

For each Starting tile that allows a player to receive a Discovery tile, draw one Discovery tile, and place it next to the Starting tile it was drawn for.

Starting with the first player, each player drafts one Starting tile (possibly with the Discovery tile it is linked to). After each player has drafted 1 Starting tile, each player drafts another Starting tile, this time in reverse player order. This means that the last player will draft 2 Starting tiles in succession.

After each player has drafted their Starting tiles, proceed with setup normally.

## DARK ECLIPSE: SUDDEN DEATH VARIANT

In a regular game of Teotihuacan, players should always have ample time to prepare for an Eclipse. However, if you wish to play a more cutthroat version of the game, you may use the alternate rules below.

* An Eclipse (scoring) happens immediately after the turn of the player who has caused the light disc to reach the space occupied by the dark disc. No extra turns are performed, players simply score and prepare further play (or finish the game) normally, proceeding with the next player.
* The same rules apply for finishing the game: it may end abruptly in the middle of a round if the third Eclipse is triggered, or if an Eclipse was triggered by finishing the Pyramid.
* If players are tied for both Victory Points and cocoa at the end of the game, the player with the highest number on the Player Order token wins the game (instead of the player with the lower number).

**Note:** We do not recommend this variant to any but the most competitive gaming groups who also favour negative interaction.

## TEOTIBOT: SOLO RULES

In the solo mode you will be playing against an automated opponent called Teotibot (or bot for short). It will simulate the interactions of a 2-player game.

**Note on difficulty:** the rules as written are tested against experienced players and provide a beatable challenge. If it is your first game and you want a slightly less challenging experience, feel free to use any number of the difficulty adjustments listed at the end of the solo rules.

### Additional components

* 7 Action tiles
* 2 Direction tiles

### Changes in setup

Set up a normal 2-player game, except that the bot starts with 2 gold, 2 stone, 2 wood (and no cocoa).

The bot starts on the 0 step of the Pyramid track, but the first (not the bottom) step of each temple (without gaining their rewards), and on the first (not bottom) step of the Avenue of the Dead track. The bot starts with a marker on the top right Technology tile (the top Technology of the green temple column), but does not gain an additional temple advancement.

Place the bot’s workers on the following Action Boards, with the following powers:

* Gold Deposits (4) Action Board (general area): power 2.
* Nobles (6) Action Board (general area): power 2.
* Construction (8) Action Board (general area): power 2.
* Decorations (7) Action Board (Worship space): power 1.

Randomly select 6 Action tiles, and build the bot’s action pyramid out of them. Place the seventh tile nearby.

Place both Direction tiles next to the action pyramid, one below the other with random sides face up.

Put two dice of an unused player colour (dice that were not placed during setup) near the bot’s action cards. It will use these during its turns to help determine its action.

The player starts the game (thus gaining 1 extra cocoa).

### General rules change

When playing the solo mode, and either you or the bot builds a Pyramid tile (using the action of the Construction (8) Action Board) or a Decoration tile (using the Decorations (7) Action Board), instead of refilling its place, slide all tiles left/up and refill the rightmost/bottom space instead.

When you unlock the bot’s worker from a Worship space, instead of moving the bot’s worker to the general area of that Action Board, move it to the next empty Temple Worship space (ignoring the Palace (1) Action Board) clockwise around the Action Board. The effect of the bot’s new placement is not performed. In the extremely unlikely event of there not being an empty Temple Worship space, the bot’s worker immediately unlocks your next (clockwise) worker locked on a Temple Worship space.

### On Teotibot’s turn

1. Roll the two unused neutral dice and add them up. That selects a tile in the action pyramid according to the following:  
   <pre>
          [ 6, 7, 8 ]  
      [ 4, 5 ]  [ 9, 10 ]  
   [ 2, 3 ] [    ] [ 11, 12 ]
   </pre>
2. Perform the action shown on the tile.
3. Remove the tile that was activated, and then shift the tiles below it (if any) that are selected by the Direction tiles one level up. Then place the previously unavailable set-aside tile in the empty space that opened up in the bottom row of the action pyramid.
4. Flip the top Direction tile to its reverse, and move it below the other Direction tile.
5. If the bot now has 10 or more cocoa, discard 10 cocoa from the bot back to the general supply, and score 3 Victory Points for the bot.
6. Advance the light disc on the Calendar track by one. This might trigger an Eclipse, the same way as in the multiplayer rules.

### Description of Teotibot’s actions

#### General note

The bot does not pay for performing actions. It only collects cocoa to be exchanged for Victory Points (or masks).

When a tile instructs the bot to power up a worker on an Action Board and there are multiple possible workers, it always powers up the one with a higher power.

When a tile instructs to find the bot’s highest powered or lowest powered worker, and there are multiple workers of the same power, select the one:

* Clockwise furthest from the Palace (1) Action Board for highest power.
* Clockwise closest to the Palace (1) Action Board for lowest power.
* When a tile instructs the bot to advance a worker, it is moved:
  * Clockwise to the next Action Board, if the worker has a power of 3 or less.
  * Clockwise to the second Action Board, if the worker has a power of 4 or 5 (so, the worker skips the nearest Action Board).

Either way, the worker ignores the Palace (1) Action Board and always moves past it.

When a tile instructs the bot to advance on any temple, advance it on whichever temple it is currently the highest on (ignoring temples where it has already reached the topmost step). When tied, choose the leftmost of the tied temples (blue, then red, then green).

When gaining resource rewards after moving up on the blue temple, the bot picks whichever resource it has the least of. If tied, Teotibot will prioritize taking gold before other resources, and taking stone before wood.

The bot always selects 5 Victory Points as the reward for Ascension, and advances on the Avenue of the Dead normally.

The bot never gains or uses Discovery tiles (other than the Mask collection action tile’s effect). When reaching a major step on a temple, it always chooses the printed reward instead of a Discovery tile.

#### Construction

1. If the bot has 2 or more stone and at least one worker on the Construction (8) Action Board, it spends 2 stone and places the leftmost pyramid tile (rotated randomly) onto the top left, lowest level space available on the Pyramid grid of the Main Board, and then:
   * Scores Victory Points for the level.
   * Advances on the Pyramid track.
   * Scores an additional 2 Victory Points and advances on any temple by one. (**Note:** This represents average points the bot would score by matching icons.)
2. If the above step failed and the bot has at least one worker on the Stone Quarry (3) Action Board, gain 2 stone.
3. If either of the above steps were successfully performed, power up a worker on the relevant Action Board (this might trigger an Ascension, which is resolved normally). Then advance the powered-up worker (or the new worker, if the old one triggered Ascension).
4. If neither of the above steps were successful, the bot gains 5 cocoa instead, powers up its lowest powered worker, and then advances it.

#### Decorations

1. If the bot has 2 or more gold and at least one worker on the Decorations (7) Action Board, it spends 2 gold and places the topmost Decoration tile onto an available Decorations space on the Pyramid grid on the Main Board (clockwise from the top). Then the bot:
   * Scores 5 Victory Points.
   * Advances on the Pyramid track.
   * Advances on any temple by one.
2. If the above step failed and the bot has at least one worker on the Gold Deposits (4) Action Board, gain 2 gold.
3. If either of the above steps were successfully performed, power up a worker on the relevant Action Board (this might trigger an Ascension, which is resolved normally). Then advance the powered-up worker (or the new worker, if the old one triggered Ascension).
4. If neither of the above steps were successful, the bot gains 5 cocoa instead, powers up its lowest powered worker, and then advances it.

#### Alchemy

1. If the bot has 1 or more gold and at least one worker on the Alchemy (5) Action Board, it spends 1 gold and then gains the Technology of the lowest number that does not have any markers (yours or Teotibot’s).
   * If all remaining tiles have your marker on, then the bot gains the lowest numbered Technology which it does not yet have, while you score the 3 Victory Points as normal.
   * Either way, advance on the temple matching the gained Technology and power up a worker on this Action Board (this might trigger an Ascension, which is resolved normally). Then the bot advances the powered-up worker (or the new worker, if the old one triggered Ascension).

   Note: the bot does not benefit from Technology tiles.

2. If the above step failed, power up its lowest unlocked worker by two, without carrying out any actions or advancing any workers.

#### Nobles

1. If the bot has at least 2 wood and one worker on the Nobles (6) Action Board, it spends 2 wood and builds a Building.
   * Before the first Eclipse, place it in the first (top) row.
   * After the first Eclipse (but before the second), place it in the second (centre) row.
   * After the second Eclipse, place it in the third (bottom) row.
   * If a row is full, place it into a space with the lowest printed Victory Point value of all three rows.
   * Score the Victory Points shown on the space just covered, and advance the bot on the Avenue of the Dead (the same way an actual player would advance).
2. If the above step failed and the bot has at least one worker on the Forest (2) Action Board, it gains 2 wood.
3. If either of the above steps were successfully performed, the bot powers up a worker on the relevant Action Board (this might trigger Ascension, which is resolved normally). Then the bot advances the powered-up worker (or the new worker, if the old one triggered Ascension).
4. If neither of the above steps were successful, the bot gains 5 cocoa instead, powers up its lowest powered worker, and then advances it.

#### Mastery

1. Find the bot’s highest powered unlocked die.
2. Perform that Action Board’s action if possible:
   * Forest (2): see step 2 of the Nobles action tile.
   * Stone Quarry (3): see step 2 of the Construction action tile.
   * Gold Deposits (4): see step 2 of the Decorations action tile.
   * Alchemy (5): see step 1 of the Alchemy action tile.
   * Nobles (6): see step 1 of the Nobles action tile.
   * Decorations (7): see step 1 of the Decorations action tile.
   * Construction (8): see step 1 of the Construction action tile.
3. If the action failed, find the bot’s next highest powered unlocked worker and repeat step 2 above.
4. If an action succeeds, power up the worker in question (this might trigger Ascension, which is resolved normally). Then the bot advances the powered-up worker (or the new worker, if the old one triggered Ascension).
5. In the extremely unlikely event of all workers failing to perform an action, the bot gains 5 cocoa instead, powers up its lowest powered worker, and then advances it.

#### Worship

1. Advance the bot’s worker on a Worship space to the next clockwise Worship space on a temple sidebar (remember: Teotibot always ignores the Palace (1) Action Board).
   * If there is one of your workers on that space, the bot unlocks that worker.
   * The bot advances on the matching temple by 2 spaces, gaining rewards for both (and gaining printed bonuses instead of Discovery tiles as mentioned before).
   * If the activated space is on the Decorations (7) Action Board, the bot advances on any temple by 3 instead.
2. Discard the Discovery tile near the activated space, and immediately draw a replacement for it.

#### Mask collection

1. If the bot does not yet have one of the masks available near one of the Worship actions (on the Palace (1) Action Board or on any of the 4 temple bands) and it can pay for its cost, it pays that cost and immediately gains that mask. Draw a replacement for it immediately, and do not move any dice. If there are multiple masks it could take, it takes the one with the lowest number first. If tied between multiple masks of the same rarity, it picks the first one clockwise, starting from (and including) the Palace (1) Action Board.
2. If the above step yielded no masks, the bot gains 5 cocoa instead, powers up its lowest powered worker, and then advances it.

### Changes in Eclipse

* Teotibot does NOT pay cocoa salary.
* Teotibot does score for masks, Pyramid and Avenue of the Dead tracks normally.
* During the third Eclipse, it scores additional points:
  * 1 Victory Point for each leftover resource and cocoa.
  * 2 Victory Points for each Technology tile it has a marker on.
  * The bot scores a flat 15 Victory Points for each Temple Bonus tile it has reached (instead of scoring them normally).
* You beat the Teotibot if you have more Victory Points at the end of the game (after the third Eclipse). If you are tied, or if Teotibot has more points, you lose.

### Changes in difficulty

You can adjust Teotibot’s difficulty using the following metrics (decreasing makes the bot easier to beat):

* Increase or decrease up to 3 of Teotibot’s starting unlocked workers’ power by 1.
* Increase or decrease the bot’s starting resources by 1 gold, 1 wood, 1 stone.
* Increase or decrease the Victory Points scored when cashing in 10 cocoa by 1 or 2.
* Increase or decrease the number of steps taken on a temple when performing a Worship action by 1.
* Increase or decrease the Victory Points awarded for the bot’s Temple Bonus tiles by 5 or 10 Victory Points.
* Increase or decrease the number of points scored for each Technology tile by 1 or 2 Victory Points.
