## GAME BOARD SETUP

1. Place the **game board** in the middle of the table.

2. Shuffle the **9 station master tiles** and place one at random face up onto each of the *5 station master spaces*. Return the remaining 4 tiles to the box.

3. Take the **7 neutral building tiles** and place one face up onto each of the *7 neutral spaces* on the game board:
   * If this is your first game, place each tile onto the space marked with its matching letter (A to G).
   * In subsequent games, shuffle the tiles and distribute them at random.

4. Place the **job market token** onto the top dashed round space in the *job market*.

5. Take the **54 worker tiles**, the **22 outlaw tiles** and the **18 hazard tiles** and turn them face down. Sort them by the numbers on their back (1, 2 and 3) and put them into their corresponding *bags*.

   Place the bags next to the game board (close to Kansas City).

   These bags are called the *Kansas City supply*.

6. From the Kansas City supply, draw **7 tiles** with a **1**
on their back and place them one after the other onto the game board.

   Where a tile is placed depends on its type:

   * If it is an **outlaw tile** (green or orange), place it in the *outlaw section* onto the empty space with the lowest number (1 to 9).
   * If it is a **hazard tile**, place it in its corresponding *hazard section* (flood, drought or rockfall) onto the empty space with the lowest number (1 to 4).

   If there is no empty space left, return it to the bag and draw a new tile.

7. Start drawing tiles with a **2** on their back (which include only worker tiles). Put these worker tiles one after the other in the *job market* as follows:

   Start in the top row and place the first drawn tile onto the space directly beneath the ***player count sign*** of your actual player count.

   Place the next tile onto the space to the right of that tile and continue like this rightwards.

   After you have placed a tile onto the rightmost space of the top row, continue along the second row, where you place the next tile yet again onto the space in line with your player count sign.

   Then continue like this rightwards until you place a tile onto the space to the left of the job market token. This is the last tile. So depending on your player count, there are now 3, 5 or 7 worker tiles in the job market.

8. Now fill the 6 *foresight spaces* in Kansas City with tiles from the Kansas City supply:

   * Draw 2 tiles with a **1** on their back and place them face up onto the two foresight spaces marked 1.
   * Draw 2 tiles with a **2** on their back and place them face up onto the two foresight spaces marked 2.
   * Draw 2 tiles with a **3** on their back and place them face up onto the two foresight spaces marked 3.

9. Shuffle the **36 market cattle cards** and place them as a face-down *market cattle stack* beneath the lower left of the game board.

   Depending on your player count, draw a number of cattle cards from this stack:

   * ***In a 2-player game***: Draw 7 cards.
   * ***In a 3-player game***: Draw 10 cards.
   * ***In a 4-player game***: Draw 13 cards.

   Sort the drawn cards by color and place them face up beneath the game board in the *cattle market*, forming an overlapping row in which the left side of each card is visible. For clarity, the cards of this row should be arranged in the following order from left to right: yellow, red, blue, brown, purple (not all colors may be present though).

   **Note:** The (orange) Simmental cattle cards are part of a variant. See page 19 for the rules and how to add them during the setup. If you prefer to play without the Simmental cards return the 24 orange cattle cards to the box.

10. Shuffle the **24 objective cards** and place them as a face-down stack to the right of the game board. Then reveal 4 cards from this stack and display them face up in a column below the stack.

    This display is called the *general objective display*.

11. Place the **coins** and **exchange tokens** within reach of all players as a general supply. This supply is called the *bank*.

12. Each player chooses a player color.

    You receive the **player board** of that color (identifiable by the 14 round colored spaces) and place it in front of you.

    If you are playing with 2 or 3 players, you also receive the **player count tile** of your color.

    Turn it to the side of the appropriate player count and use it to cover up *Phase A* of your player board.

13. You receive the **12 private building tiles** of your color.

    These building tiles are double sided and each is marked with a number (between 1 and 12) and with the lowercase letter ‘a’ on one side and the lowercase letter ‘b’ on the other.

    * In your first couple of games, turn your private building tiles to the ***a-side*** and displays them in an ascending order of required builders above your player board.
    * If you know the game a little better, you may try the following: Choose a player who determines the side of each of the building tiles at random (for example by tossing them in the air) and then displays them in ascending order of required builders above the player board. Afterwards all other players copy the display by turning their tiles to the same sides.

    Thus, for the remainder of the game, the side of each building tile is identical for all players. No one may deliberately flip a building tile to its other side.

14. You receive the following items of your color:

    * **14 discs** - which you place onto your player board to cover up each of the colored disc spaces. (Only the 2 gray spaces in the upper left remain empty.)
    * **1 engine** - which you place onto the starting space (the red building) of the *railroad track* on the game board.
    * **1 certificate marker** - which you place onto the top space of your certificate track (next to the 0).
    * **1 herder** - which you place next to your player board for now.

15. Then you receive the **14 player cattle cards** that are marked with a star of your color.

    These 14 cards make up your *herd deck*.

    Shuffle your herd deck and place it as your face-down  *personal draw stack* to the left of your player board.

16. Shuffle the **4 starting objective cards** and deal each player one random card, which you place face up below your player board. This is the first card of your *personal objective area*.

    Return any remaining starting objective cards to the box.

17. Finally, determine a **starting player**, the other players will follow in clockwise order.
Receive your ***starting capital*** and ***1 exchange token*** from the bank and draw cards from your personal draw stack to add them to your ***hand***.

    * 1st player: 6 dollars, 4 cards and 1 exchange token
    * 2nd player: 7 dollars, 5 cards and 1 exchange token
    * 3rd player: 8 dollars, 6 cards and 1 exchange token
    * 4th player: 9 dollars, 7 cards and 1 exchange token

**You are now ready to start the game.**

**Important: At the beginning of your very first turn of the game,** discard cards from your hand until you have only 4 remaining. Discarded cards go to your *personal discard pile*.

Then place your herder onto **any** neutral building tile and continue directly with phase B. You may start on the same building tile as other players.

## OBJECT OF THE GAME

On your turn, you move your herder along a trail that winds and forks from the lower right corner of the game board to Kansas City in the upper left. Along your path, you perform actions that provide you with various ways to earn victory points. For example: Placing private building tiles, buying cattle from the cattle market, upgrading train stations and removing hazards.

Each time your herder reaches Kansas City, you must send cattle off by train to another city, which may also be worth victory points. Afterwards, your herder continues its movement again in the lower right corner of the game board. Throughout the game, your herder will reach Kansas City about 5 to 7 times.

All victory points are awarded at the end of the game. Then, you add up the victory point symbols on the various components in front of you as well as the ones marked with your color on the game board. The player with the most victory points wins the game.

### Deck Building

**What is your herd deck?**

Your *herd deck* represents your herd, which you lead along the trail. Each cattle card of that herd represents one animal of a specific cattle type, clearly denoted by the card’s color and *breeding value*.

Each player starts with an identical herd deck of rather low breeding values.

However, during the game, you can improve your deck by adding market cattle cards with higher breeding values as well as objective cards to it.

Your *herd deck* is made up of the following parts:

* Your face-down personal draw stack to the left of your player board.
* Your hand cards that you draw from that draw stack according to your hand limit (you start with a hand limit of 4 cards).
* Your face-up personal discard pile, onto which you place any cards that you discard from your hand as well as any cards you acquire during the game.

**Important:** When you must draw a card from your personal draw stack but have no cards left in that stack, then (and only then) pick up your personal discard pile, shuffle it thoroughly and place it as your new face-down personal draw stack to the left of your player board. Then continue to draw cards from it as usual.

**What is the purpose of the cattle cards?**

On the locations of the trail, there are several actions that require specific cattle cards to be discarded from your hand in order to gain rewards.

Also, each time you reach Kansas City, you want to have many different types of cattle with high breeding values in your hand: The more varied and valuable they are, the more money and victory points are in store for you.

## GAMEPLAY

Beginning with the starting player (the one with a starting capital of only 6 Dollars), players consecutively take turns in a clockwise order. On your turn, you must carry out all of the following phases in this order:

**PHASE A** Move your herder to another location along the trail

**PHASE B** Use the action(s) of your reached location

**PHASE C** Draw up to your hand limit

Then it is the next player’s turn.

***Note:** The 3 boxes at the top of each player board give an overview of the 3 phases.*

## PHASE A Move your herder to another location along the trail

**What is considered a location?**

The main location of the trail is Kansas City. Furthermore, any **tile** that is placed on a space of the trail is considered a location (building tiles, hazard tiles and outlaw tiles).

**Spaces without any tile are considered an unimpeded part of the trail and are NOT locations!**

In this phase, you must move your herder from its current location along the trail to another location.

For this, bear the following rules in mind:

* The movement of your herder is measured in *steps*. **Each location** along your path takes **1 step** (remember, empty spaces along the trail are not considered locations).
* You must always move your herder **forward** along the intended direction of the trail (as indicated by the arrows).
* If the trail forks, choose one of the available paths to continue along.
* The location on which your herder ends its movement (either because you want it to or because your step limit is exhausted) is the location you use in phase B.
* You are not allowed to pass over Kansas City. So when your herder reaches Kansas City, it must end its movement there.
* The herders of the other players do not interfere in any way with your own herder. Several herders can be on the same location.
* You must move your herder **at least** 1 step and are not allowed to move it more steps than the current ***step limit*** your player board indicates. (Depending on your player count, you start with a step limit of 3 or 4, which later in the game can be increased.)

**Attention:** Several locations show a green or black hand (or both). If your herder moves to or passes over such a location, you must immediately pay a fee:

1. If it is a hazard or outlaw tile, you must pay the fee to **the bank**.
2. If it is a private building tile of another player, you must pay the fee **to that player**.

The fee depends on the player count and the color of the hand(s):

In a 2-player game:

* each green hand costs 2 Dollars
* each black hand costs 2 Dollars

In a 3-player game:

* each green hand costs 2 Dollars
* each black hand costs 1 Dollar

In a 4-player game:

* each green hand costs 1 Dollar
* each black hand costs 2 Dollars

**Important:** If you cannot pay for some or all of the hands along your path, you are still allowed to move. This means that if your herder moves to or passes over a location whose fee you cannot pay, pay as much as you can and continue as usual.

You never have to pay fees retroactively, even if you receive money while still at a location whose fee you could not pay before.

This only applies to fees levied by hands. All other costs and requirements in the game must always be paid/met in full.

## PHASE B Use the action(s) of your reached location

After moving your herder, use the location on which it ended its movement. However, your options on the location differ depending on whether it is:

1) A neutral building tile *or* a private building tile of your own color
2) A private building tile of another player, a hazard tile *or* an outlaw tile
3) Kansas City

### 1. On a neutral building tile or a private building tile of your own color, you have two options:

**EITHER** use the local action(s) of that tile **OR** use one single auxiliary action

### Use the local action(s)

Most building tiles show two different *local actions* on their bottom half. These actions are separated from one another by full-length dividers. (Only a few building tiles show just one or more than two local actions.)

* You may now perform **each** of that tile’s local actions **once**.
* You may perform these local actions in **any order**.
* You do not have to perform all of the available local actions. But if an action shows a cost or requirement, you have to pay/meet it completely in order to gain that action’s reward.
* A few tiles show two actions (separated by a white slash) within the **same** local action. You are only allowed to perform one of those actions.
* Some spaces of the trail have *risk actions* attached. If a building tile is placed on such a space, the risk action becomes part of that tile’s local actions and thus can be performed by its owner each time that player reaches the location.

#### Use one single auxiliary action

If you do not perform **any** of the local actions of the reached tile, then and only then may you perform **one *single auxiliary action*** instead.

Your auxiliary actions can be found on the left side of your player board in the *auxiliary action section*.

At the beginning of the game, only 2 of them are available. Each of the other auxiliary actions becomes available after you have cleared at least one of its two disc spaces (again, you will learn soon enough how to do that).

### 2. On a building tile of another player, a hazard tile or an outlaw tile, you have only one option:

Perform **one *single auxiliary action***.

***Note:** This means, of course, that you will usually try to reach a neutral building tile or a building tile of your own color, because only there can you perform local actions.*

### 3. When you reach Kansas City, you **must** carry out all of the 5 *Kansas City subphases* in succession.

   To make sure that you do not forget any subphase, move your herder along the numbered spots and perform the corresponding subphase before moving on to the next spot.

#### The 5 Kansas City subphases are:

   1. **Foresight 1:** Choose one of the 2 tiles in the *foresight spaces* below spot 1 and move it to its corresponding section.
   2. **Foresight 2:** Choose one of the 2 tiles in the *foresight spaces* below spot 2 and move it to its corresponding section.
   3. **Foresight 3:** Choose one of the 2 tiles in the *foresight spaces* below spot 3 and move it to its corresponding section.
   4. **Income:** Reveal your entire hand, calculate your income and gain that amount from the bank. Then discard your hand to your personal discard pile.
   5. **Delivery:** Move one of your player discs from your player board onto a city crest and pay any transport costs arising.

#### 1, 2, 3 Foresights

Each of the 3 tiles that you choose in subphases 1, 2 and 3 must immediately be moved to its corresponding section:

##### Outlaw tile

If it is an ***outlaw tile*** (green or orange), place it in the *outlaw section* onto the **empty** space with the lowest number. If no empty space is left there, take the outlaw tile out of the game by returning it to the box.

##### Hazard tile

If it is a ***hazard tile***, place it in the corresponding *hazard section* (flood, drought or rockfall) onto the empty space with the lowest number. If no empty space is left there, take the hazard tile out of the game by returning it to the box.

##### Worker Tiles

If it is a ***worker tile***, place it onto the next free space of
the *job market*. To determine that next free space, apply
the following rules:

* The tile must always be placed in the row where the job market token is located.
* The spaces of that row must always be filled from **left to right**.
* If you are playing with fewer than 4 players, also consider the following:

  **In a 3-player game**, each row only comprises 3 spaces (starting beneath the 3-player count sign) and the entire left column is left empty.

  **In a 2-player game**, each row only comprises 2 spaces (starting beneath the 2-player count sign) and both left columns are left empty.

* The last space to be filled in each row is always the one with the job market token. And as you place a worker tile onto that space, move the job market token along the arrow to the dashed round space of the next row.

Usually, when the job market token is moved to the next row, nothing in particular happens. However, when the job market token is moved along a **yellow arrow**, you must immediately fill up the ***cattle market***.

When this happens, draw from the market cattle stack as many cards as it takes to bring the cards in the cattle market up to their initial number:

* ***In a 2-player game***: Fill the cattle market up to its total of 7 cards.
* ***In a 3-player game***: Fill the cattle market up to its total of 10 cards.
* ***In a 4-player game***: Fill the cattle market up to its total of 13 cards.

As in the setup, sort all cattle cards by color and place them face up in an overlapping row in which the left side of each card is visible. For clarity, the cards of this row should be arranged in the usual order from left to right: yellow, red, blue, brown, purple.

* If you must fill up the cattle market but the number of cattle cards in the market is already equal to (or higher than) the total for your player count, don’t add any cards to it.
* If the market cattle stack is empty, no more cards are added to the cattle market.

If the job market token is moved from the bottom row along the **green arrow**, the end of the game is triggered.

#### 4 Income

Reveal your **entire** hand to the other players and calculate its *total breeding value*. To do this, sum the breeding values of each **different type** of cattle that you have in hand. This means each type is counted only once, no matter how many cards of that type you have. (Ignore any victory points on your cattle cards and any objective cards for now.)

Then, if possible and if you like, you can increase that total breeding value by adding certificates to it. There are 2 types of certificates in the game: temporary certificates and permanent certificates.

***Temporary certificates*** are those on your certificate track: The number next to the current position of your certificate marker tells you how many temporary certificates you have available. Of those, you can use as many now as you want by moving your certificate marker backwards accordingly.

***Permanent certificates*** are those on the upper half of any station master tiles in front of you: Each of those increases your total breeding value by the number indicated on the tile for the rest of the game. (*On how to receive station master tiles see section “Upgrading train stations” on page 14.*)

Once your total breeding value is set (including any certificates), take that many Dollars from the bank. Place this amount a little set off from the rest of your money so that you are able to track that total breeding value in subphase 5.

Then discard **all** cards from your hand to your personal discard pile.

#### 5 Delivery

The cattle for which you just received your income must now be delivered to a city along the railroad track. The crest of each city shows a *city value* that corresponds to that cattle’s total breeding value: the higher the total breeding value, the farther up the railroad you can deliver.

To do this, decide on a city whose city value is **equal to** or **lower than** your cattle’s total breeding value. Bear in mind, however, that you are **not** allowed to choose any city to which you have delivered before (that already has one of your discs on its *city space*). The only exceptions to this rule are:

* the local city, Kansas City and
* the terminal city, New York.

You may deliver to either of these cities even if you already have one or more of your discs there.

Once you have decided on a city, place one of your player discs onto its city space (if other discs are already there, put it on top of those). Take that player disc from any of the *disc spaces* of your player board but keep in mind that there are 2 types of disc spaces: Those with white corners and those with dark corners.

1. A disc from a disc space with ***white corners*** can be placed onto **any** city space.
2. A disc from a disc space with ***dark corners***, however, can only be placed onto a city space that **also has dark corners**.

By clearing a disc space of its disc this way, you unlock its ability. Note that some of the disc spaces with dark corners have additional requirements or give rewards for clearing them.
