# Ganz Schön Clever Rulebook

## THE GAME

In Ganz Schön Clever choose your dice well then enter them into the matching colored area, put together tricky chain-scoring opportunities, and rack up the points. The dice you don't use are as important as what you do because every die that's smaller than the chosen is offered to other players ‘on a silver platter’, keeping everyone in the game at all times.

## CONTENTS

* 1 Scorepad
* 6 Dice
* 4 Markers

## SETUP

Each player receives a pen and score sheet. Randomly choose a start player, who gets the 6 dice.

## GAMEPLAY

The game is played over four (4 players), five (3 players) or six (1 and 2 player) rounds. 

At the start of each round all the players simultaneously cross off the box of the actual round
and, in turns 1-4, all players simultaneously get one bonus as shown on the Round Tracker
(above) on the score sheet (players choose ONE of the two options in round 4).
Actions or bonuses all players receive each round
Active Player
The active player rolls all 6 dice, then chooses ONE die - placing it on one of his 3 dice fields
(top left of score sheet), without changing the number of the die.
Using the chosen die, the player must now enter the value shown on his sheet in
the same color field (see score sheet on page 4). The white die is a wild color
and can be used in place of any other color.
Then the active player puts all dice with a
lower value than the chosen die on the
silver platter (printed in the box).
If a player picks the lowest value die then no dice are
placed on the silver platter.
Dice on the silver platter can no longer be used by the
active player (exception: Additional Dice action).
With the remaining dice, the active player rolls a second time. He again chooses a die,
places it on a free dice field and enters its value in the matching color field on his game
sheet. As before, all dice that show a lower value than the selected die again are placed on
the silver platter.
The active player then rolls a third time and repeats the process one last time. He then
places ALL remaining dice not on his score sheet on the silver platter.
Attention: If a player decides in the first or second roll to take high dice, it may happen that
there are no dice left for a reroll. If this happens, the player simply performs fewer than three
rolls. Of course, it’s best to avoid this situation.

Example:
1. Luca is the active player and rolls the dice
Start with all 6 dice:
2. He chooses the purple die, lays this on a
free dice field and enters the 3 in the purple
area of his playing sheet:
3. Luca lays all the dice with less than 3 pips
on the silver platter:
4. Luca then rolls a second time with the
remaining 4 dice:
5. He chooses the white (wild) 4, places the
die on the next free dice field and decides to
also to enter the 4 in the purple area:
6. He then places all dice with less than 4
pips on the silver platter:
7. For his third throw Luca has only the
orange die. He rolls a 3 and puts it on the last
free dice field and enters the number in the
orange area.
Passive Players
After the active player has placed 3 dice on
his game board or can no longer reroll
because all remaining dice are on the silver
platter, the non-active or ‘passive’ players get
a turn.
All passive players now get the dice set aside
on the silver platter. Of these dice, each
player can choose one die to use to mark a
space on their score sheet. All passive
players choose simultaneously, and a die
can be chosen by multiple passive
players.
After each passive player has marked their
chosen die, the player to the left becomes the
active player. He gets all six dice and rolls
and rerolls, as described previously.
A round ends after each player has been
the active player once.


The Score Sheet
The score sheet has five colored areas. For each die, a
player will mark one field or write one number in one
space.
Three areas (green, orange, purple) show an arrow
on the left. You will start entering numbers at the left
of these lines and proceed right, in order without
skipping spaces.
In the two areas without arrows (yellow and blue), you can
enter an appropriate number no matter where it is.
The White Area
The Yellow Area
The white die is wild and can either be used as a yellow, green,
orange, or purple die or can be combined with the blue die to
create a sum for the blue area.
Yellow dice are recorded by the player in this area. You simply
cross out the value of the chosen die in this area. Although
each value appears twice, you may only cross out one block per
chosen die. Spaces can be marked off in any order. Once a
column is completed, the player circles the starred number at
the bottom of the column. These points are considered scored.
The bonuses at the end of a row will be explained later.
Points at the End of the Game (yellow):
All circled numbers are added.
The Blue Area
Here, as in the Yellow area, boxes can be completed in any
order. If a player chooses a blue die, then add the current value
of the white die to it to determine the combined value - no
matter where the white die is.
The same applies in reverse, if the player uses the wild white
die as a blue… He adds the blue die to the white die as
before—again, regardless of where the blue die is.
Players cannot take the value of only one die when filling in the
blue area (to mark the 2 both dice would need to show a 1).
If the active player chooses the blue die on one roll and the
white die on another roll, they could potentially mark two blue
area fields on one turn. 

Points at the End of the Game (blue):
At the end of the game, players count how many
marks they have made in the blue area. The point
scale at the top of the area indicates how many points
they will get for this section.
Using green dice, players can mark off spots in the green area. Players must start at
the leftmost space and proceed to the right, not skipping any spaces. For each space,
players must meet the minimum required value in order to be eligible to mark the next
space. Bonuses shown under the required values will be explained later.
Points at the End of the Game (green):
The white number in the star above the last selected field indicates the number of points
scored for this section at the end of the game.
Using orange dice, players can mark off spots in the orange areas. Players must start
at the leftmost space and proceed to the right, not skipping any spaces. For each
space, players record the value of the selected orange die. There are no restrictions
here, but there are spaces that have multipliers. Here the player multiplies the die
value times the multiplier and records that number (a 4 marked on an “x2” field is
recorded as an 8).
Points at the End of the Game (orange):
At the end of the game, players score the sum of all recorded numbers from the orange row.
Using purple dice, players can mark off spots in the purple areas. Players must start at
the leftmost space and proceed to the right, not skipping any spaces. For each space,
the number entered must be higher than the previous number.
There is an exception!
After a player enters a 6, any number may come next (e.g. 2 < 5 < 6 < 3 is acceptable).
Points at the End of the Game (purple):
At the end of the game, players score the sum of all recorded numbers from the purple row.
(2+5+6+3=16)

SPECIAL CASE
If a passive player can’t use any die from the silver platter, they may use one die from the
active player’s pad. A player CANNOT refuse a die from the silver platter to do this.
If the active player can’t use any of the dice from a given roll, they simply cannot put a mark on
their sheet for that roll. This still counts as one of their maximum of 3 rolls.
Players can earn bonuses, which are listed at the end of rows or
 columns or directly below certain fields.
X-bonus: As soon as a player completes a row, column, or field with an Xbonus, they must immediately mark a box in the corresponding color area.
This can be any number in the yellow or blue area and will always be the
next field in the green area.
The black X-bonus available at the start of round 4 can be used to fill in a yellow, blue, or
green field, as described above.
A purple or orange background with a number indicates that a player can
immediately place this number in their next available space in the corresponding
area. This can be done immediately, if possible, and cannot be saved for later.
The black 6-bonus available at the start of round 4 can be used to fill in a 6 on either the
purple or orange row.
If entering a bonus awards another bonus,
it is executed immediately, so players can chain bonuses.
Summary of Bonuses:
Bonus on an individual field = Redeemed immediately as a number is entered in this field.
Bonus at the end of a line or column =
Redeemed only once all fields in the line/column are marked.
THE FOXES:
Foxes award points at the end of the game. When a Fox bonus is
activated it’s a good idea to circle it so you don’t miss it later. Each
activated fox will score as many points as the player’s lowest-scoring
colored area.
Example: If a player’s worst-scoring area is orange with 5 points,
each fox will score that player 5 points.
Attention: If player scores 0 points in an area, foxes are worthless! 

## THE ACTIONS

The two action bars can be unlocked during the game. Unlike
bonuses, actions can either be used immediately after they have
been unlocked or can be saved for a later turn.
When a player unlocks an action, they should circle the next space
in the corresponding row to indicate that it is available. After they use
the action, they should cross out the first available circled space.
Players can perform as many actions as they wish in a given
turn, provided they still have actions available.
Reroll action: This can be used only by the active player. If they wish to reroll all of the
dice they just threw (NOT dice on their sheet or on the silver platter), they can spend an
action to do so. ALL rolled dice must be rerolled when doing this (you cannot keep some
dice and reroll others).
Extra die action: Using this action, an extra die can be selected. This action can only be
performed at the end of a turn (after the active player has regularly assigned all of his
dice his die fields or after the passive player(s) have chosen a die from the silver platter).
With this action, the player can choose any of the six dice, including a die that the active
player has taken or even that player just took with their regular action! Players can use
multiple additional die actions during a single turn, BUT each individual die can only
be chosen once in a turn in this manner.
CANNOT be selected again!! However, he can choose
the blue dice and thus, together with the white dice, tick
one 7 in blue (blue 3 + white 4 = 7).
Example: The active player has chosen the dice and entered them on his game
sheet. He still has two extra die actions. For one he chooses the white cube again
and crosses off a yellow 4. With the second extra die action the white cube
CANNOT
GAME END
THE ACTIONS
The game ends after the last active player has finished their last turn in the last round AND after
passive players have all taken their actions for that turn. Each player can use Additional Die
actions here, but any remaining Reroll actions will expire.
A player will then record the scores for each player in each colored area. Earned foxes will be
scored for each player (number of foxes times that player’s lowest scoring area). 

Points are summed, and the player with the highest total wins. If there is a tie, the player with
the highest score in an individual area breaks the tie. If no winner can still be determined, the
victory is shared.
SOLO GAME
The goal of the solo game is to score as many points as possible.
The rules are largely the same.
The solo game lasts 6 rounds. The player starts as an active player then takes the role of the
passive player before becoming active again. Thus, the player will be each active then passive
6 times.
When the player is in the passive role, he rolls all six dice and places the three lowest value
ones on the silver platter. If it’s a tie, three dice are still placed, with the die closest to the
silver platter breaking the tie.
Example:
The passive player rolls:
The player places these 3 dice on the silver platter: the blue 1 and
the purple 2 as the lowest dice; and the orange 3 because, of the 3
dice showing 3’s, it is physically closest to the silver platter.
Attention: Like in a multi-player game, as passive player you cannot
use the re-roll action but you CAN use the +1 die action.
How "clever" a player has played can be seen from the following table.
