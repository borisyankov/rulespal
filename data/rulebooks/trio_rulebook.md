# Trio Rulebook

## Table of Contents

## CONTENTS

**36 cards** (Three each of 1-12)

## OVERVIEW

**Three is the magic number!** Be the first player to collect a certain number of trios *(three identical number cards)* depending on the mode of play:

### SIMPLE MODE

* **Any three trios.**

  *or*

* **The 7 trio.**

### SPICY MODE (Advanced)

* **Two connected trios.** The connected numbers are shown in the bottom corners of the cards.

  *or*

* **The 7 trio.**

## SETUP

1. Shuffle and deal cards face down to each player according to the number of players. Place the remaining cards **face down** in the middle, next to each other.

   | Number of players   | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |---------------------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
   | Cards per player    | 9 | 7 | 6 | 5 |
   | Cards in the middle | 9 | 8 | 6 | 6 |

2. All players pick up their cards and sort them into numerical order, lowest to highest, without showing anyone.

3. Decide if you are playing **SIMPLE** or **SPICY** mode.
*(We recommend **SIMPLE** if this is your first time playing.)*

## HOW TO PLAY

Whoever most recently ate something with avocado goes first and play continues to the left. On your turn, try to find three of the same number card. To do this, **reveal cards one at a time in one of two ways:**

1. **Reveal the LOWEST or HIGHEST card from any player's hand, including yours.** Ask an opponent to reveal either their lowest or highest card. *(You could also reveal your lowest or highest card.)* Place the card face up for all to see.

2. **Reveal a card from the middle.**  
Turn any card in the middle face up for all to see.

**Continue playing until one of the following happens:**

* You reveal a card that doesn't match the previous one. In this case, all revealed cards are then put back where they came from: either face down in the middle and/or returned to their owner(s).

*or*

* **You complete a trio by finding all three matching cards.** Congratulations! Take the trio and place it face up in front of you.

**In either case, your turn is over.**

### IMPORTANT:

* You can perform the same action several times.

  ***For example:** ask an opponent to reveal their highest card, then ask again for their highest remaining card.*
* When you reveal a card from your own hand, it **must be the lowest or highest** number. *(**NEVER** a number from the middle or your hand.)*
* If you don't have any cards left in your hand, you may still play using the cards in the middle and your opponents' cards.

## WINNING

A player immediately wins as soon as they collect:

* Three trios (**SIMPLE** *mode*)

  *or*

* Two connected trios (**SPICY** *mode*)

  *or*

* **The 7 trio** *(which always beats everything else!)*

## TEAM VARIANT

*(for 4 or 6 players)*

*Make the following adjustments to the main rules:*

### SETUP

1. Form teams of two players: Two teams if there are four players and three if there are six. Sit opposite your partner, not side by side.
2. Shuffle and deal all the cards face down evenly to all players. No cards go in the middle.
3. After secretly sorting cards, you may **swap one with your partner**. All teams do this at the same time.

#### Swapping:

If two partners wish to swap cards, they secretly select one of their cards, exchange them facedown at the same time, and put them discreetly in the correct place in their hands.

### Communication:

**Swapping is the only form of communication allowed between partners.** All other forms of communication are prohibited *(eye signals, kicking under the table, showing where a swapped card was placed, etc.)*.

### HOW TO PLAY

* Each time a team wins a trio, the opposing team(s) can make a new swap.
* Partners share any trios they won. *(Keep them together in front of one partner.)*

### WINNING

**A team wins as soon as they have collected:**  
3 trios or 2 connected trios depending on the game mode (**SIMPLE** or **SPICY**) or **the 7 trio**.
