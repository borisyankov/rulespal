### Unlocked components discovered during play (divided into 5 boxes):

* 32 tiles
* 31 cards
* 8 markers
* 5 wooden Hearts
* 1 plastic stand

### Using the Insert:

In the upper 3 compartments of the insert there are 5 boxes. These contain new, additional game material. Don’t open these boxes until instructed to do so.

Next to the boxes, you will be able to store the wooden hearts you will unlock from the boxes, and to the right of that, there is a compartment for cards unlocked during the course of the campaign. Then on the far right, there is room for all the Task markers.

You can place the Score pad over the middle compartment of the boxes and cards, and the Campaign pad over the entire upper area of the insert.

In the lower area of the insert, there is space for all the hexagonal tiles. All Task tiles fit into the left compartment, all Landscape tiles fit into the right compartment, and all Special tiles you unlock can be kept in the middle compartment.

## SETUP

**Mix all the Task tiles facedown.** Create any number of facedown stacks and place them at the edge of your playing area.

**Now mix all the Landscape tiles facedown. Then draw 3 and return them to the box without looking at them.** These will not be used in this game. Then create any number of facedown stacks with the remaining tiles and place them at the edge of your play area—separate from the Task tiles.

**Now mix the 25 Task markers facedown** and separate them by color (or icons). Then place them facedown at the edge of your play area next to the stacks of Task tiles. Place the Score and Campaign pads aside as you won’t need them until the end of the game.

**Important:** Don’t open any of the 5 boxes until you are instructed to do so!

## GOAL OF THE GAME

You all cooperate to create a beautiful map by placing tiles while also completing the residents’ tasks. You are also trying to create both the longest continuous Track and the longest continuous Stream possible, all while taking the Flags into consideration as well! The better you succeed in each of these goals, the more points you’ll score at the end of the game.

Based on your scores from game to game, you will unlock new components hidden in the 5 boxes. These will give you additional tasks that will enable you to increase your high score in subsequent games.

## COURSE OF THE GAME

Determine a start player. Then, beginning with the start player, you will take turns in clockwise order until the end of the game.

On your turn, you will reveal either 1 Landscape tile or 1 Task tile, which you will then place into the play area according to the placement rules (see page 3). Before placing, discuss where this tile might be best used with the other players. Once it’s been discussed, you make the final decision as to where to place it.

The following rules determine whether you will reveal a Landscape tile or a Task tile:

**In the first 3 turns of the game, you must reveal 1 Task tile.**

**Whenever** you reveal a Task tile, you must **immediately take 1 matching Task marker** to add to the **Task tile**. Flip the Task marker so the number is visible and place both tiles together in the play area.

There are 5 different Task types.

* Forest Task
* Grain Task
* Village Task
* Track Task
* Stream Task

**For each subsequent turn after the first 3 mandatory selections, you must first check how many Task tiles with Task markers are in your play area:**

A) If there are **fewer than 3 Task tiles with Task markers** on them, you must reveal **1 Task tile** and place it in the game area with the matching Task marker on it according to the placement rules.

B) If there are **3 Task tiles with Task markers** on them, turn over 1 Landscape tile and place it in the play area according to the placement rules.

Now for the **placement rules** – where and how do you place a tile?

**The fundamental rule:** All tiles must always be placed so they maintain a single connected group of tiles. This means you must place each tile with at least 1 of its 6 edges against an edge of a tile already in the play area.

In addition, you must also adhere to the following 2 placement rules:

* **Tracks and Streams must always match edges with their type.** For example, you are not allowed to connect edges with a Stream to edges without a Stream. (Obviously, it is possible for you to add tiles with non-connecting track and river edges in your play area in hopes of connecting them later.)

* On the other hand, you are allowed to place the Landscape types **Forest**, **Grain**, and **Village** (as well as the neutral **Meadows**), **however you wish** as they are not required to match.

### Completing Tasks

Each Task marker shows a number (4, 5, or 6) that specifies **exactly** how many tiles must be in the corresponding territory, Track, or Stream in order to complete the Task marker.

A **territory** consists of 1 or more tiles of 1 type connected with matching edges (Forest, Grain, or Village). Task markers can be fulfilled immediately after being placed.

Whenever you complete a Task marker, move it to your Completed Task Marker area. To provide an overview during the game, sort your completed Task markers individually by type next to each other. At the end of the game, completed Task markers are an important source of points.

Don’t forget: The next tile that is placed must be a Task tile because there will now be fewer than 3 Task tiles with Task markers in the play area.

**Additional Details:**

* You may place Task tiles in a territory, Track, or Stream that already contains 1 or more Task tiles with or without a Task marker.

* You **may not place a Task tile** that would cause a territory, Track, or Stream to consist of **more** tiles **at the moment you place it** than the current Task marker requires. You are also not allowed to complete a territory, Track, or Stream with a Task tile with a Task marker if this closes off the Territory, Track, or Stream resulting in a territory, Track, or Stream with fewer tiles than the new Task marker requires. (Closed off means there is no longer an open edge to add a tile to fulfill the new Task marker for that territory.)

* You are allowed to place a tile in a territory, Track, or Stream that now **contains more tiles** than any Task marker that is already in place requires. In this case, you must remove the Task marker and return it to the box. Similarly, you must remove a Task marker if you close off a territory, Track, or Stream with a **Landscape** tile **in such a way that there are fewer tiles** than the Task marker requires.

* By placing a tile, you may complete more than 1 Task marker at the same time. Remember you must continue playing Task tiles for the next few turns until there are 3 Task tiles with Task markers on them in the play area.

* If you run out of Task tiles, you can’t play any more Task tiles. Continue playing by placing only Landscape tiles until the end of the game.

### Flags

At the beginning of the Campaign there are 3 Landscape tiles in the game with a Flag.

A green Flag is always associated with the Landscape type Forest, a yellow Flag with Grain, and a red Flag with Village tiles.

Follow the usual placement rules when adding a Flag to the play area just like any other tile.

But be careful: At the end of the game, you only gain points for Flag territories if they have been closed off, which means the territory doesn’t have any open edges.

## END OF GAME

The game ends immediately when you are required to reveal a Landscape tile and there are none left. Any remaining Task tiles that have not been revealed and placed yet won’t come into play this game. (Tip: You should try to keep the number of unrevealed Task tiles as low as possible.)

If you complete a Task with the last Landscape tile (or cancel one), the game continues with revealing and placing new Task tiles until you can’t complete (or cancel) any more Tasks.

Now calculate your points.

You will need 1 Scoresheet per game. After scoring, transfer your results to the Campaign sheet, which will track and show when and how you can unlock new components from game to game.

Here is how you use your **Scoresheet**:

**A** Enter the game number for your completed game in the crown for the Campaign.

**B1 - B5** Calculate the total for all completed Task markers for each Landscape type and enter the sums in the corresponding spaces. You score points for: all completed Forest Tasks **B1**, all completed Grain Tasks **B2**, all completed Village Tasks **B3**, all completed Track Tasks **B4**, all completed Stream Tasks **B5**. On the far right, enter the grand total of all completed Tasks **S1**.

**C1 - C3** Now determine which Flags are in completed territories, as they are the only ones that will score: For each Flag in a completed Territory, gain points equal to the number of tiles in that Territory. Enter the total in the appropriate space: points for green Flags **C1**, points for yellow Flags **C2**, points for red Flags **C3**.

**D1 - D2** Count how many tiles are in your longest Track and your longest Stream in the play area. (All tiles of the same type that are adjacent to one another without a break in the connection count for Tracks or Streams.) Enter the number of tiles in the spaces for the longest Track **D1** and the longest Stream **D2**. On the far right, enter the grand total of points for Flags, the longest Track, and longest Stream **S2**.

**E** At the beginning of the Campaign, ignore this area. You can only enter points here once you have unlocked new components. At the start of each subsequent game for your campaign, we recommend checking off all the boxes on the Scoresheet for components you have already unlocked (so you know which ones you will score at the end). Record the total points gained for this section in the rightmost space. **S3**

**F** Enter the player names for this game here.

**G** Enter the date for the game here.

**H** Enter the grand total of points for your game here. (Sum of the grand totals from **S1** + **S2** + **S3**)

Now that you’ve scored the game, turn to your **Campaign sheet**.

First, enter your result in the High Score List by finding the row that corresponds to your result. (Round your result down to the closest lower value in the first column. For example, 128 points rounds to 120.) Then, in the right column marked with a crown, enter the game number in which you achieved this result. (You can achieve a result multiple times.)

The middle space for this row shows you how many of the small white circles you may cross off on the Advancement track in the middle of the Campaign sheet. Cross these off now, beginning at the very bottom left of the hiker.

Always cross out one white circle after the other. Don’t count the green hexes when crossing out, just skip those. After the second green hex, the Advancement track forks. You can always freely choose the adjacent white circle you want to cross out next— depending on what you want to unlock next. Remember, all crossed off circles must be adjacent to each other (including via the green hexes).

Whenever you reach a green hex, you’ve unlocked something:

The first green hex unlocks Box 1. The second green hex unlocks Box 2. All the other green hexes will unlock a new Achievement card from Box 3. Each time you reach one of these green hexes, open Box 3 and take out the named card and, if necessary, any additional components (as indicated on the card). In addition, there are 3 white circles in the Advancement track that unlock a Red Heart when you cross them off. These can also be found in Box 3.

Unlocked components are added to the game according to the directions on the Achievement cards. Basically, the following rules apply:

First, cross off the box for what you have unlocked in the list on the right of the table. (The top section of the Campaign sheet lists everything you’ve unlocked from Box 3 and the bottom section lists everything you’ve unlocked from Boxes 1, 2, 4, and 5.) All unlocked components are always used in all further games for the Campaign.

When opening an unlocked box, begin by reading the Components card which describes its contents. In the boxes, you will discover Achievement cards that you will place faceup next to your play area in future games. If you manage to complete the condition on an Achievement card during a game, turn it over and follow the instructions on the back *(Achievement card unlocked)*.

### The Achievement Cards

The Achievement cards are composed as follows:

On **top of the front side** next to the heading Achievement, you will always see a closed lock icon:

**Achievement Card**

On the bottom of the card, you will discover what you can unlock and how to unlock it. (Cards from Box 3 are turned over immediately.)

The heading on the back will be Achievement Unlocked with an open lock icon next to it:

**Achievement Unlocked!**

On this side you will discover what you have unlocked, some- thing new to do, and, if applicable, new rules. (One Exception: In Box 1 there is 1 card that is unlocked immediately. The heading on the front side will be *Achievement Unlocked* along with all the necessary information. On the back, you'll find 2 examples.)

From now on, keep all the Achievement cards you haven't un- locked separate from those you have already unlocked.

Mix new Landscape tiles in with the other Landscape tiles and new Task tiles in with the Task tiles. Extra space has been accounted for in the insert so that everything will fit in the respective compartments. You will also unlock new **Special tiles**, which become a third type of tile. These have the same back side as Landscape tiles and are distinguished by a Sign Post with icons on the front:

If a Special tile with a Sign Post has a special way to be scored, it will display an icon as a reminder of how you may score these points.

In all other cases, the Sign Post will display an exclamation point icon.

Even though these Special tiles have the same back side as Landscape tiles, there are special rules for them in 3 situations (each highlighted in **bold** on the Achievement card). In addition, there is a separate compartment for the Special tiles in the insert.

**Important: Don’t mix in your Special tiles** (that is, the tiles with a signpost) **with the other Landscape tiles** during game setup until **after you’ve randomly drawn 3 Landscape tiles** to return to the box without looking at them.

You may pause a Campaign at any time to start a new one or to continue another Campaign in a different group. Use the Components cards for each lock box to be sure you store the components in the correct boxes. The overview on the right edge of your Campaign sheets will remind you of what you have already unlocked in the respective Campaigns.

*How far can you push your high score?*

*How many games do you need to unlock all the new game components?*
