# CuBirds Rulebook

## Table of Contents

**Every day, dozens of birds perch on the fences of our countryside. When it is time to fly away, these birds jumble up, unable to organize themselves into flocks to fly home. Help them find their way back to their nest.**

## Setup

One player is randomly designated as the dealer. The dealer then shuffles the 110 Bird cards and lays out 4 rows with three cards faceup at the center of the table. Each row must be composed of 3 different Birds. If the same Bird is present multiple times on a given row, discard the extra Birds and place new cards until each row contains 3 Birds from different species. All of the remaining cards are shuffled to form a facedown draw pile. This draw pile is placed near to the center of the table, accessible to all players. The dealer gives 8 facedown Bird cards from the draw pile to each player: The game ends immediately if it is impossible for the dealer to deal 8 cards to each of the players even after reshuffling the discard pile into a new draw pile. The player with the most Bird cards in their collection then wins the game. In case of a tie, tied players share victory.. Then the dealer deals one Bird card to each player, faceup, which the players keep in front of them: **this is the first Bird in their collection**. Keep enough free space next to the draw pile to form a discard pile.

There are **110 Bird cards** in the game, distributed in **8 species**. The bottom-left corner displays the number of copies of each Bird.

## Object of the game

The game is won by the first player that manages to have gathered in their collection in front of them:

* Either 7 different species
* Or 2 species of at least 3 Birds

## Game overview

A game plays in several successive rounds. At the beginning of each round, each player starts with 8 cards in their hand. A round continues until one of the players has no cards left in their hand. Starting with the dealer and going clockwise, each player fully completes their turn before proceeding to the next player. On their turn, a player lays one or more cards at the center of the table in order to pick cards on the table to put into their hand. Then they can complete a Flock in order to add Birds to their collection.

Players take turns until the end of the round or until a player manages to win the game.

## Turn of a player

On their turn, a player **must** lay one or more Birds from their hand, then they **may** complete a Flock. The play then proceeds to the next player, going clockwise.

### 1. LAY BIRDS (MANDATORY)

The player chooses a Bird from their hand and must play **all the Birds of this species** that they have in their hand. They lay these birds, each one next to the other on the left or on the right side of one of the 4 rows at the center of the table. They can choose their cards independently of the species of the Birds already present in the rows. If a player places a Bird in a row that already has one or more Birds **of that species**, the player must take **all the cards** between these Birds into their hand.

Next, the player slides the remaining Birds together, so that they form a continuous
row.

If (and only if) there is only **one species of Birds** left in the row right after the player took cards from it, the dealer must add cards from the draw pile to this row, one by one, until there are two different species in it.

The Birds added from the draw pile can be placed either on the left or on the right of the row.

It may occur that a player lays one or more Birds without surrounding **any other cards** between Birds of the same species. In this case, the player takes no cards from the center of the table. If they choose so, they have the option to **take the two first cards from the draw pile** and add them to their hand.

### 2. COMPLETE A FLOCK (OPTIONAL)

A Flock is a series of Birds of the **same species**. Completing a Flock allows the player to add one or two Bird cards to their collection, which is kept in front of them.

*Flocks can come in two different sizes: small or big.*

* The number for a small Flock is displayed on the left.
* The one for a big Flock is displayed on the right.

*All Birds from the same species also possess the same Flock numbers.*

In order to complete a Flock, the player has to reveal **all the Birds of the same species** that they hold in their hand.

If the number of revealed cards is higher or equal to the number stated for a small Flock, the player adds **one of these revealed cards** to their collection.

If the number of revealed cards is higher or equal to the number stated for a **big Flock**, the player adds **two of these revealed cards** to their collection.

In both cases, remaining cards are placed into the discard pile.

A player is not allowed to reveal cards if they do not have enough of them to complete a Flock.

On their turn, a player can only complete **a single Flock**, but they are **never forced** to complete a Flock. Once a Bird has been added to a playerâ€™s collection, it can never be put back into their hand or into the draw pile.

## End of a round

As soon as a player has **no cards left in their hand**, the current round ends. Other players have to place any cards that they have left in their hand into the discard pile. **The cards laid in rows at the center of the table remain in place.**

The player who just ended the round becomes the new dealer and gives 8 cards from the draw pile to each player. If the draw pile gets empty, shuffle all the cards from the discard pile to form a new draw pile. **The new dealer is the first to play in this round.**

## End of the game

If a player has **7 different species or 2 species of at least 3 Birds** in their collection at the end of their turn, they win the game. The play immediately stops and the round is ended.

The game ends immediately if it is **impossible for the dealer to deal 8 cards to each of the players** even after reshuffling the discard pile into a new draw pile. The player with the most Bird cards in their collection then wins the game.

In case of a tie, tied players share victory.
