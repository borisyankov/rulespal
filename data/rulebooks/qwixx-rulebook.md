# Qwixx Rulebook

## Table of Contents

Each player tries to mark with a cross, on his card, as many numbers in the four colour-rows as possible. The player gets more points the more crosses he has in one colour-row. Whoever has the most points, in total, at the end wins.

## Crossing numbers

It is a basic rule that, in the course of the game, the numbers must be crossed out **from left to right** in each of the four colour-rows. But you do not have to begin with the number farthest on the left. You are allowed to leave out numbers (even several at once). Numbers that have been left out may not, however, be crossed out afterward.

**Note:** If one wishes, one can cross through those numbers that one has left out with (instead of a cross) a small horizontal line, so that they are not crossed out later by accident.

## The way the game is played

Each player gets a card and something to write with. Lots are drawn to decide which player first takes on the role of “active player”. The active player throws with **all six dice**. The following two actions are now carried out **one after the other**: first the first action and **only then** the second one.

1. The active player adds the pips of the **two white dice** together and says aloud, and in a clear voice, the sum that thereby results. **Each player may** then (but is not **obliged to**!) cross out the number that the active player has spoken out in **any** colour-row of his choosing.
2. The active player (but not the others!) **m**ay then (but is not **obliged to**!) add together the pips shown on **just one white dice** together with the pips shown on **just one coloured dice of his choosing** and cross out the number corresponding to this sum in the colour-row corresponding to the colour of the dice chosen.

**Very important:** If the active player crosses out a **number neither in the first nor in the second action**, he must make a cross in the column “**Misthrows**” (Fehlwürfe je -5). The non-active players do not need to mark a misthrow, regardless of whether they have chosen to cross out a number or not.

Now the next player clockwise becomes the new active player. He takes all six dice and throws. Then the two actions described above are carried out, one after the other, and the game goes on in this way.

## Finishing a row

If a player wishes to cross out **the number at the extreme right end** of a colour-row (red 12, yellow 12, green 2, blue 2) he must first have made **at least five crosses** in the colour-row in question. If he makes a cross on the number on the extreme right, then he should **also** make a cross on the field directly next to it which shows a lock symbol. This latter cross will also be counted in the final calculation of total crosses! This colour-row is now finished and closed off **for all the players** and no more crosses can be made in this colour in any of the subsequent rounds. The dice of the colour corresponding to it is immediately removed from the game and is no longer needed.

**Please note:** If a player crosses out the number at the extreme right end of a colour-row, then he must announce this loudly and clearly, so that the other players know that this colour-row is now out of the game.

If the closing-off of a row occurs during the first action, it is possible that other players may, at the same time, also conclude and close off the same colour-row and cross out the lock symbol at the end of it. But if a particular player has hitherto made less than five crosses in the colour-row in question, he shall not have the right to make a cross in the extreme-right field, even if the row has been closed off by another player.

## End of the game

The game ends **immediately** as soon as someone has marked his fourth misthrow. It also ends **immediately** as soon as two colour-rows have been completed and closed off (regardless by which players) and dice of two colours have consequently been removed from the game.

**Note:** It may occur (during the first action) that a third row is closed off simultaneously with the second row.

## Scoring

Beneath each of the four colour-rows there is indicated how many points are awarded for how many crosses within each row. Every misthrow means five minus-points. Each player enters his points for his four colour-rows and the minus-points for his misthrows in the appropriate fields at the bottom of the card. The player with the highest total result is the winner.
