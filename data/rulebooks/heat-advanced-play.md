## Garage Module

In the Garage Module, each player builds their own customized car with 3 Upgrade cards. The Starting Upgrade cards are not used in this module so put them back in the box.

Instead, use the Upgrade cards which are divided into 2 levels : Basic and Advanced (identified by this icon). TODO

In your first few Garage Module games, we recommend that you only use Basic cards. When you are familiar with this system, feel free to add the Advanced ones into the mix.

### Upgrade Cards

The Upgrade cards come in various categories based on how they modify the race cars. There is no restriction whatsoever around including these categories in your deck. They are described here, in no particular order, so you have a feeling of how they will impact your game.

#### 4 Wheel Drive

This early system was designed to transfer all the force from the engine into the tarmac through all four wheels but it resulted in poor handling. These cards have the potential of high Speed or Cooldown but also reduce control because they flip cards like Stress.

#### Brakes

Brakes are all about how late you can make a decision to overtake or step on the brake, and still stay on the track. These cards have variable speed where you make a decision as you reveal the cards.

#### Cooling system

Provides a more stable and clean drive ; a better fuel economy and less stress to the car. These are cooldown cards.

#### Body

A safer car with better balance that does not understeer. These cards allow you to discard Stress cards.

#### R.P.M.

A powerful engine allows your car to respond faster. When played at key moments, those cards make it easier for you to accelerate past opponents. They are cards that help you slipstream and overtake all over the track, but are most effective in and around corners.

#### Tires

It is about grip through width and durability. These cards allow you to go faster on corners or sacrifice the grip for a lot of cooldown.

#### Wings

Creates downforce in corners but it lowers the top speed. These cards help you drive faster in corners but they are also unreliable, thus requiring Heat.

#### Turbocharger

A bigger engine giving you more horsepower and a higher top speed but also increasing weight and wear. These are the highest valued cards and require you to pay Heat.

#### Fuel

Racing fuel is highly regulated. These are the super fuel “illegal“ cards.

#### Gas Pedal

The car reacts more quickly to pressure on the accelerator. These cards increase your overall speed.

#### Suspension

Giving you a smoother drive, these cards can be played round after round.

### Building Your Car

After placing the cars on the starting grid, but before starting the race, you’ll go through 3 rounds of Upgrade card drafting. In each round you select one Upgrade card, for a total of 3 per player. This is done as the final step of setup before drawing 7 cards into your hand.

> Quick start - You can experiment with random upgrades, by simply shuffling all Basic Upgrade cards and dealing 3 random cards to each player.

Shuffle the deck of Upgrade cards. Place one card per player, +3 extra cards, face up on the game board. This is the market for the first round of the draft. One at a time, players pick a card from the market in this order:

* **1st round** - pick cards from back to front on the starting grid; first pick is by the player whose car is **last**. Continue until everyone has taken a card. Then discard leftover cards and create a new market for the second round.
* **2nd round** - pick cards from front to back on the starting grid; first pick is by the player whose car is **first**. Continue until everyone has taken a card. Then discard leftover cards and create a new market for the third round.
* **3rd round** - just like in the first round, pick cards from back to front on the starting grid. Continue until everybody has taken their third and final Upgrade card. Then discard the leftover cards.

All players shuffle their 3 Upgrade cards into their draw deck before the race starts.

### Using Upgrade Cards

#### During the Reveal and Move Step

Most Upgrade cards give a fixed Speed value and all you need to do is add that value to your Speed, as you would do with regular Speed cards. Some of them, on the other hand, feature Boost Symbols or several values to choose from.

When you reveal your cards, always start by resolving Boost Symbols (wherever they come from) by following the usual process described in the Stress section on page 5 of the Rule booklet for each of them.

Finally, choose the value of any Upgrade card that gives you a choice and add those values to get your final Speed.

#### During the React Step

Most of the Upgrade cards feature symbols that impact you. The order in which you apply them within the React step (step 5) is always up to you. Some are optional and do not have to be applied, but others must be applied as they represent the cost of playing the Upgrade card; these are identified by the Mandatory icon TODO.

### Mandatory Symbols

#### Heat

Take # Heat cards from the Engine and move them to your discard pile.

***Note:** If you accidentally played an Upgrade card and you cannot pay the Heat cost of it, discard it and play a random Speed card from your draw deck instead by following the usual process as described in the Stress section on page 5 of the Rule booklet.*

#### Scrap

Take # cards from the top of your draw deck and flip them into your discard pile.

#### Adjust Speed Limit

If you cross a corner this turn, your Speed Limit is modified by # for you; “+” means you can move faster, “-” means you must move slower.

### Optional Symbols

#### Cooldown

Take up to # Heat cards from your hand and return them to the Engine spot.

#### Slipstream boost

If you choose to Slipstream in step 6, your typical 2 Spaces may be increased by the indicated #.

#### Reduce Stress

You may immediately discard up to # Stress cards from your hand to the discard pile.

#### Refresh

You may place this card back on top of your draw deck at the end of the React step.

#### Salvage

You may look through your discard pile and choose up to # cards there. These cards are shuffled into your draw deck.

#### Direct Play

You may play this card from your hand. If you do, it applies as if you played it normally, including Speed and mandatory/optional icons.

#### Accelerate

You may increase your Speed by 1 for every card flipped this turn (from Upgrades, Stress and Boost). If you do, you must increase it for all the flipped cards.

## Legends Module

Legends are automated drivers you can compete against in solo mode or as additional opponents in multiplayer games. They are controlled by a single deck of Legends cards. Much like players, if a Legend is close to a corner it will try to clear it but sometimes fail. If it is far from a corner it will move as fast as possible, without overshooting.

We suggest racing with Legends if there are less than 4 players in the game, and adding a minimum of two Legends if adding any at all. However there is no right or wrong choice, so feel free to experiment.

### Setup

* Shuffle the 10 Legends cards and place them face down on the Legends mat.
* Pick as many Legend opponents as you want and add the cars to the mix when you randomly fill the Starting Grid.

### Using Legends

Each round—when it is time for the first Legend to move in the Reveal & Move step—reveal the card from the top of the Legends deck. The flipped card will be used by **all** Legends this round. Each Legend does either movement A or B depending on where their car is on the track relative to the Legends Line.

The Legends Line helps the automated drivers decide how to handle corners. If they are past the Legends Line, they will tackle the corner more aggressively but if they haven’t yet reached the Line for the upcoming corner, they will get as close to the corner as they can without overshooting it.

#### A\ Clearing Corners

If a Legend has crossed the Legends Line (their car is between the Legends Line and the next corner), move the car forward as many Spaces as the Speed Limit of the upcoming corner plus the number in the Diamond above the helmet in their color on the flipped card.

***Note:** Legends may never cross 2 corners in the same move. If this is about to happen, place the Legend car on the first Space with a free Spot before the second corner.*

#### B\ Approaching Corners

If a Legend has not crossed the Legends Line, they will try to get as close to the next corner as possible, without overshooting it. There are two possible outcomes:

* If the Legends can move at their Top Speed (the number inside the helmet in their color) **without** clearing the next corner, then they will do so.
* If moving at that Top Speed would cause them to clear the next corner, instead, move the Legend forward **to the space** numbered 0-3 just before the next corner (based on the number in the Diamond above the helmet in their color).

### Additional Notes

* Legends never Slipstream, use Heat, or Cool Down their cars.
* Legends count when determining Adrenaline, even though they get no benefit from it.
* When the Legends deck is empty, shuffle all cards into a new Legends deck.

> **Pro Legends** - You can make the Legends tougher opponents by increasing the Top Speed values on all cards by 1, or even more. The designers usually race against Legends with a +2 Top Speed.

## Weather and Road Conditions Module

You can modify any track by adding Weather and Road Conditions tokens to your race. Prepare Weather and Road Conditions before you draft Upgrades so you can customize your car to handle this specific race.

* Shuffle the 6 Weather tokens and draw one for the entire race. Place it on the Billboard Space on the board. Adjust how many Heat or Stress cards you have for the race depending on the effect of the token.
* Shuffle the 12 Road Conditions tokens and draw one for each corner of the race track. If the token shows an arrow, it modifies the next sector (all spaces between this and the next corner). Put the token on the tent of that sector next to the track. Tokens without an arrow modify the corner.

### Road Conditions Tokens

Road Condition tokens have a permanent effect on specific corners or sectors of the race track and add symbols that need to be taken into account during the React step.

Tokens with this icon TODO are mandatory, while the other ones are optional and you can choose when to apply them exactly as you would with Upgrade symbols.

#### Corner Effects

##### Adjust Speed Limit

Speed limit is 1 higher.

##### Adjust Speed Limit

Speed limit is 1 lower.

##### Overheat

If your Speed is higher than the Speed Limit when you cross this corner, the cost in Heat that you need to pay is increased by one.

#### Sector Effects

##### Slipstream boost

If you choose to Slipstream in step 6, you may add one extra Space to the usual 2 Spaces. Your car must be located in this sector before you slipstream.

##### Heat control

Do not pay Heat to boost in this sector (still max one boost per turn). Your car must be in the sector when you boost.

##### Weather

Weather effect applies to this sector. See the Weather token for the effect (explained below).

#### Car Setup

* Shuffle 1 extra Stress card into your deck.
* Remove 1 Stress card from your deck.
* Place 1 extra Heat card in your Engine.
* Remove 1 Heat card from your Engine.
* Shuffle 3 of your Heat cards into your draw deck.
* Place 3 of your Heat cards into your discard pile.

#### Weather Effects

##### Slipstream boost

If you choose to Slipstream in step 6, you may add 2 extra Spaces to the usual 2 Spaces. Your car must be located in this sector before you slipstream.

##### No slipstream

You cannot start slipstreaming from this sector (you may slipstream into it).

##### Cooling Bonus

+1 Cooldown in this sector during the React step.

##### No cooling

No Cooldown allowed in this sector during the React step.

### Weather Tokens

Weather tokens always modify the car setup for all players **before** the race. They may also have a Weather effect in some sectors of the track if a Weather Road Conditions token is in play.

## Championship System

> Your car jumps away from the line in the first race of the 1961 season and you smile as you draft
off your main rival, ready to make a move. Experience a full season by improving your car
between races, adapting to the unpredictable weather, and capitalizing on opportunities to be a
media star and attract new sponsors. During your races, rack up the most points and become the
new World Champion.

The game comes with three “historic” Championship Seasons: 1961 (3 races), 1962 (3 races) and 1963 (4 races). We suggest you start with the 1961 Season. You can also shuffle the Event cards and create your own unique 4 race Season (see page 10).

### Setting Up the Championship

* Decide which Championship Season to race and find the matching Event and Track cards.
* Each player chooses a color and takes the car, player mat, gear pawn and 12 Speed cards in their color. Starting Upgrade cards won’t be used and can be returned to the box.
* Take a Championship scoresheet that you will use for the whole season.
* Place the Championship mat on the side of the table. It will be used to keep the tokens and card decks organized (as they all share the same back) and to store the active event card.
* Shuffle the Sponsorship Cards into a Sponsorship deck and put it face down on its spot on the Championship mat.
* Prepare the Upgrade Deck by deciding whether you want to use Basic Upgrades only, Advanced Upgrades only or all of them together. Return unused Upgrade cards to the box as they won’t be used this Season. Shuffle the chosen Upgrade cards into an Upgrade Deck and place it face down on its spot on the Championship mat.
* Shuffle the Weather tokens and put them into a face down pile on their spot on the Championship mat.
* Shuffle the Road Conditions tokens and put them into a face down pile on their spot on the Championship mat.
* Put the Heat and Stress cards face up as a reserve close to the Championship mat.

> ### GOAT!
>
> Play the 1961, ’62 and ’63 seasons in succession to determine who is the Greatest Of All Time. At the end of each season all players keep a single Upgrade card of their choice among the ones they have for the next season.

### Before Each Race

* Find the Event card for your race (see Season and race number at the bottom of the card) and put it face up on its spot on the Championship Mat as a reference. This card will also indicate the Track to use. Place the matching Board in the middle of the table and grab the matching Track card.
* Place cars on the starting grid. First race: Draw them randomly. Later races: Follow the Championship standing. The player with the most Championship points is in first, pole position, and so on (tiebreaker is whoever was best positioned in the previous race).
* Then go through the steps shown on the right side of the Event card from top to bottom.
* **Build your car:** You add only one Upgrade card before each race so the car is gradually improved over the Season. Draw one card per player, +3 extra cards from the Upgrade deck, and put them face up on the game board. One at a time, players pick a card from this market starting with the player who is last on the starting grid and going upwards. Place it face up in front of them. After everyone has picked an Upgrade card, the player that is last on the starting grid (if you play with Legends, simply ignore them in this process) may decide to swap one Upgrade card they already have with one of the leftovers from the market. Finally, shuffle any leftover cards back into the Upgrade deck.
* **Sponsorship:** All players draw the number of Sponsorship cards shown on the Event card, which will be part of their 7-card starting hand. See rules for Sponsorship cards on page 10.
* **Press corner:** Place a Press Corner Standee on the race track next to the corner(s) shown on the Event card (use the Track card to find out which corners). See rules for press corner on page 10.
* **Weather & Road Conditions:** Draw the topmost Weather token from the pile and place it face up on the Weather Billboard on the game board. Then all players take as many Heat and Stress cards as indicated on the Weather Billboard taking into account any modification from the Weather token. Draw one Road Conditions token for each corner of the race track and put them on the board as explained on page 6.
* **Event:** Read the special event on the Event card aloud so that everyone is familiar with it. It might be a setup or rules change, or it could be a challenge.
* Place your player mat in front of you. Shuffle your 12 Speed cards, Upgrade cards (don’t forget the one you just drafted), Sponsorship cards you may have from a previous race and Stress cards together and place this draw deck face down on the left spot of your player mat. Place the Heat cards face up on the Engine spot in the middle of the player mat and your Gear pawn in first gear.
* Take the Sponsorship cards you got earlier into your hand and draw as many cards from your draw deck as needed to reach your hand size (usually 7 if not modified by the special event) into your hand. These are the cards available to you in the first round of the game. You are ready to begin!

### After each race

* Record the Championship points each player won for this race on the scorepad as indicated on the Hall of Fame below.
* All players keep their Upgrade cards and unused Sponsorship cards along with their Speed cards for the next race. Return Heat and Stress cards to the reserve.
* Shuffle all Sponsorship cards that were used during the race back into the Sponsorship deck.
* Shuffle the Weather token and the Road Conditions tokens back into their respective piles.
* Find the Championship Event and Track cards for the next race and start setting up again.

> Saving the Game State If you don’t plan to play the whole season in a single sitting, now is a good time to pause the game. The insert in the box is designed to help you keep things organized until next time!

### Completing a Championship Season

* The player with the highest total Championship points is the winner. Tiebreaker is whoever was best positioned in the final race of the season.

### Sponsorship Cards

Sponsorship cards are special upgrades that are one-time use only. You remove them from the game at the end of the turn where you play them. Like any other Upgrade card you are allowed to discard them. Unused sponsorship cards are carried over to the next race of the season but are of no value when the season is over.

Each time you gain a Sponsorship card, draw one from the top of the Sponsorship deck directly into your hand. If the deck is empty, simply shuffle the cards that were played since the start of the race to form a new Sponsorship deck. If there are no such cards, you don’t get anything.

***Note:** You do not gain any sponsorship in a turn where you spin out.*

### Press Corner

The international press is waiting in a specific corner for something spectacular to happen. This gives all players a permanent challenge throughout the race. To gain a Sponsorship card this way you must either:

* Cross the Corner Line thanks to your Slipstream move (Speed is irrelevant in this case),

**or**

* Exceed the Speed Limit of the Press Corner (potentially modified by a Road Conditions token) by 2 or more.

***Note:** You cannot gain more than one Sponsorship card each time you go through a Press Corner.*

### Customizing Championship Seasons

To create your own unique 4 race Championship season, use the Track cards to randomize their order. Before each race, draw a random Event card that will happen on that specific track. Then go through the normal setup.

## Tournament Mode

If you feel more competitive and want a different challenge, we suggest you try the Tournament Mode:

* No one adjusts their Gear during the 1st step of the round, but everyone still plays cards.
* Once you get to the Reveal & Move step, you show how many cards you played and only then adjust your Gear.
* If you adjusted the Gear up/down two steps, you immediately have to pay 1 Heat in your Reveal step.

***Note: If you accidentally shifted two Gears but cannot pay the Heat, adjust the number of cards accordingly:

* If the mistake happened while shifting up, discard one of the played cards at random
* If the mistake happened while shifting down, flip cards from your deck until you reveal a Speed card and add it to your play area like when you play a Stress card.

Finally, place your Gear pawn into the correct Gear.***
