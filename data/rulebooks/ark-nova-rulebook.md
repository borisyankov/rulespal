## INTRODUCTION & GOAL OF THE GAME

In Ark Nova you plan and build a modern, scientifically managed zoo. You build enclosures according to the animals’ way of life and support conservation projects to ensure the preservation of animal species.

Gathering diverse animals increases the attractiveness of your zoo, advancing you on the Appeal track and generating higher revenues. Likewise, careful stewardship of the animals allows you to support conservation projects, such as breeding programs, that lead to your advancement on the Conservation track and corresponding bonuses. These two tracks progress in opposite directions – if your counters meet, the game ends. Whoever achieves the best combination of appeal and conservation has built the most successful zoo and wins the game.

Association work in different zoo associations allows you to partner with zoos and universities around the world. Together, with specialists and sponsors, they will help you manage the various tasks needed to achieve your goals.

Both the designer and the publisher have made every effort to be realistic in the implementation of this game. In rare cases, however, concessions have been made for the sake of the game mechanics. For example, the koala has the subclass bear, which is often used colloquially, but does not correspond to reality. The same applies to the enclosure requirements.

## SETUP

### Global Setup

1. Place the **game board** in the center of the table. Take the **Break token** and place it on the start space of the Break track that corresponds to your player count. *If there are three players, place the Break token on the space marked 3.*
2. Shuffle the 9 **Bonus tiles** and place a random Bonus tile face up on each on each of the 4 blank yellow Bonus spaces on the board. Do not place any tiles on the two yellow spaces with icons. Return the remaining 5 tiles to the box. They are not used in the game.
3. Shuffle the **Zoo cards** to create a face-down deck on the game board on the space marked with TODO. Deal 6 **face-down** cards from the deck to the spaces provided on the game board (you will turn them faceup at the end of setup). This is the display.
4. Place the 2 **organizers** next to the game board as the general supply.
5. Place the **Association board** next to the game board, leaving enough room for one row of cards above and one row of
cards below the board.
   * Place 1 **partner zoo** of each continent and 1 **university** of each kind on the spaces provided on the Association board.
   * Shuffle the **Base Conservation Project cards** and place them face-down as a deck next to the Association board. In a 4-player game, place the 4 topmost cards face up **below** the board, otherwise the 3 topmost.
   * In a **2-player game,** take 6 player tokens of any unused color and cover:
      * on the face-up **Base Conservation Project** cards: the left level on the left card, the middle level on the middle card, and the right level on the right card.
      * on the **Association board:** the three spaces in the left column of the **donation area.**
  The covered levels / spaces are considered blocked and cannot be used by either player.
6. Shuffle the Final Scoring cards and place them face down next to the Association board.
7. Randomly determine a start player. Turn order is clockwise.

### Personal Setup

For your personal setup, each of you takes the following steps:

A. Take a random Map A **zoo map,** and place it with that side up in front of you. Return the remaining zoo maps to the box. They are not used in this game.

> 4 of the 8 zoo maps have Map A on one side. All 4 copies of Map A are identical and we recommend it for your first game. It allows you an easy entry into the game and offers generous rewards.
>
> The other 4 zoo maps have Map 0 on one side (they make up another identical set of 4). This map is suitable for beginners after the first game.
>
> On the other side of all zoo maps you will find Maps 1–8; these are the advanced maps. These are all different and give you an individual special ability. We recommend these maps once you are familiar with the game. When playing with these, for your personal setup, take 2 random zoo maps and choose 1 of the advanced maps. Alternatively, you could also lay out player count +1 advanced zoo maps and choose 1 each in reverse order of play. In both cases, return any unselected maps to the box.
>
> If you are already familiar with the game and are playing a game with beginners, you can give them a small starting advantage with Map 0 and a larger starting advantage with Map A.

B. Take one set of Action cards each, consisting of the card
types Build, Cards, Animals, Association, and Sponsors.
Place one card with side I up under each of the five card
slots on your zoo map: the Animals card under the slot
furthest to the left showing the 1 and the remaining
cards randomly distributed under the other 4 slots.

C. Choose a **color** and take all components of this color.

* Place the **counters** for appeal TODO, conservation TODO, and reputation TODO on the first spaces of their tracks on the game board. Place your counters on the Appeal track according to turn order: The start player starts on space **0** on the track; the second player in turn order starts on space **1;** third on space **2** and fourth, on space **3.**
* Take 7 of the **player tokens** in your color and place them on the designated spaces at the left edge of your zoo map. Keep the remaining player tokens next to your zoo map for later use.
* Take the 4 **association workers** and place 1 on the notepad of your zoo map, as the active worker, and the remaining 3 lying down on the designated spaces below the notepad.

D. Take 25 money from the supply and put it on the
notepad of your zoo map.

E. Draw 2 Final Scoring cards and place them next to your zoo map. You may look at them at any time, but make sure to keep them hidden from the other players.

F. Draw 8 Zoo cards. Choose 4 of them to keep as hand cards and discard the remaining 4 cards to a face-up discard pile on the discard space on the board. Make sure to keep your hand cards hidden from the other players.

> A face-up discard pile is easier to distinguish from the other card piles. This prevents you from unintentionally drawing the wrong card type. Of course, you can keep the discard pile face down, if you prefer.

> We recommend that you choose 1–2 Sponsor cards and 2–3 Animal cards as your first hand cards. Make sure that the cards do not have conditions you cannot fulfill early on in the game. If possible, choose cards with icons matching the Base Conservation Projects on display. Alternatively, you can also use suggested starting decks with game tips for the first moves.

G. After you have all chosen your hand cards, reveal the 6 cards on the display.

## GAMEPLAY

Ark Nova does not play in formal rounds; instead, players simply take turns (in clockwise order) taking one turn at a time until the end of the game is triggered. In addition, there are so-called *breaks* in between, when the game is put on hold for an administration phase. During these breaks you will discard cards down to your hand limit, recall workers, and gain income, among other things. The break procedure is explained in detail on page 18.

You always perform one action during your turn, which may trigger additional effects and bonuses. You perform these actions with the 5 Action cards displayed below your zoo map. You can expand your zoo, play Zoo cards, and draw new Zoo cards. The position of the Action card determines how much you can do with that action. For more details on this mechanism, see the chapter *A Turn / The 5 Action Cards* on page 8.

### Your Zoo Map

Your zoo (1) is established in the large area in the middle of your zoo map. This is where you place buildings such as enclosures (standard or special enclosures), kiosks, pavilions, or unique buildings. An overview of all enclosures shows their sizes and shapes (2).

You are not allowed to build on the rock (R) and water (W) spaces, but some animals need an enclosure next to a rock or water space. All other spaces are building spaces, meaning you can place buildings on them. A space that has been built on is referred to as covered in game terminology. You are not allowed to build on spaces with the icon until you have upgraded your Build action card (see A Turn / The 5 Action Cards on page 8 for more information).

Some spaces show a placement bonus (3). You receive the bonus indicated by the icon immediately when you cover it. The Icon overview explains all bonuses.

The left edge of your zoo map has bonus spaces that can be activated by supporting various conservation projects (4). At the beginning of the game these spaces hold 7 player tokens. Whenever you support a conservation project, you take one of these player tokens and place it on the Conservation Project card. This always gains you an immediate bonus and sometimes you gain that bonus again in each break.

The bottom of your zoo map has card slots to hold your Action cards (5). The number above each slot shows the strength of the Action card in that slot.

On the more advanced zoo maps you will find a special ability that distinguishes your zoo from all others (6). Map A, which we recommend for your first game, has the same special ability for all players. At the beginning of the game, place a 3-space enclosure on the indicated spaces, with the side showing the number 3 (the empty side) up.

### Zoo Cards

The most important components in Ark Nova are the 3 different types of Zoo cards. The individual card types will be explained in detail later.

Animal cards are used to add animals to your zoo. They require an empty enclosure and provide your zoo with appeal points.

Sponsor cards allow you to hire specialists, build unique buildings, or achieve various other effects, among other things.

With Conservation Project cards you support conservation projects to collect conservation points. Usually, you specialize in specific animal species and the continents from which they originate. In some conservation projects, you are going to reintroduce animals into the wild. In addition to the Zoo cards for conservation projects, there are also Base Conservation Project cards that are available at the start of the game.

### The Break Track

The game board has a Break track to count down the time remaining until the next break.

At the beginning of the game, and after each break, the Break token goes on the starting space corresponding to your player count (1). Whenever you advance the Break token, move it the appropriate number of spaces towards the end of the Break track. When you reach the last space of the track (2), you call a break for everyone (see page 18).

The break takes place after the end of your current turn. You get 1 X-token for reaching the last space of the Break track. Ignore any additional steps on the track (i.e. stop here). After the break, place the Break token back on the starting space of the track.

The right side of your zoo map has spaces for **partner zoos (7)** and **universities (8),** of which there are 5 and 3 different ones respectively. Note that there are partner zoos on all 5 continents, but you can only establish partnerships with a maximum of 4 of them. Whenever you establish a new partnership with a zoo or a university, place the tile on the lowest empty space of the appropriate column. To get a third partner zoo, you must first upgrade your **Association** action card (see A Turn / The 5 Action Cards on page 8 for more information). The different background color and the icon serve as reminders. If there is a bonus depicted on the space where you place your partner zoo or university, you immediately receive that bonus.

A **partner zoo** makes it easier for you to accommodate an animal from that continent in your zoo, because the cost to do so is reduced by 3 money per continent icon on the Animal card.

A **university** grants you the bonuses and icons it shows. To the right are the supply spaces for your additional association workers (9), which you place here at the beginning of the game. Just like with partner zoos and universities, you use them from the bottom to the top, except that rather than placing tiles, you remove workers. Whenever you are allowed to hire an association worker, you take one from here and place it on the notepad above as an active worker. Certain zoo maps reward you with conservation points for hiring your last worker.

All of your available association workers, money, and X-tokens are kept on the **notepad (10)** space above.

### A Turn / The 5 Action Cards

Your Action cards are located below your zoo map. Each card is always assigned to a card slot at the bottom of the map. The number on the card slot indicates the strength X with which you can use the Action card located there. The numbers range from 1 on the far left to 5 on the far right, meaning the further to the right your Action card is when you perform the action, the more powerful the action will be.

On your turn, choose one of your Action cards to perform its action, shift it to be lower than the others in the row, then perform the action of that card with a strength of X. After completing the action, remove the chosen Action card from its slot, shift all Action cards to the left of the newly empty slot to the right, and place the chosen Action card in the now-empty slot 1.

You may use X-tokens to increase the strength of an action. For each X-token you use, increase the strength X of the action by 1. Then return the token to the general supply. You can use as many X-tokens as you like in one action. With some actions, however, a strength greater than 5 no longer improves the action. You can never have more than 5 X-tokens. You set the strength of an action before you perform it. This means you can’t use X-tokens gained while performing the action to increase the strength of this action.

Some Zoo cards allow you to execute an effect “after finishing” your action. In this case, complete your action, including moving the Action cards, before executing the effect.

At the beginning of the game, all your Action cards are displayed on **side I**. If you receive a card upgrade TODO, you may flip an Action card of your choice from **side I** to **side II**. The card remains in its current card slot. Starting with your next action, you can then use that Action card to perform an improved version of the action for the rest of the game.

> There are 4 ways to upgrade one of your Action cards in the game: on the Conservation track, the Reputation
track, and when you gain your second partner zoo or your
second partner university. One of them allows you to choose
an alternative. So be aware that you cannot upgrade all of
your Action cards! In each game you will have to decide which
upgrades are most important to you.

You may not “do nothing” with your action (e.g. play 0 Animal cards or build 0 buildings).

The individual actions are explained in detail on the following pages. Here is a short overview of the actions:

#### CARDS Action (page 9)

The Cards action allows you to gain new Zoo cards (Animals, Sponsor, and Conservation Project cards) from the deck or the display.

#### BUILD Action (page 10)

Enclosures are needed to accommodate animals in your zoo. The Build action allows you to build standard enclosures for animals of all categories or special enclosures for particular animal categories. You can build kiosks and pavilions as well.

#### ANIMALS Action (page 11-13)

With the Animals action you can add animals to empty enclosures. You need to fulfill special conditions for this and pay the cost for the animal acquisition. In return, animals give you special abilities and add icons to your zoo, which you might need to support conservation projects.

#### ASSOCIATION Action (page 14-16)

With the Association action, you send your association workers to work in zoological associations. With their help, your reputation increases, you can gain universities and zoos from other continents as partners, support conservation projects, or donate to animal conservation.

#### SPONSORS Action (page 17)

The Sponsors action gains you the support of sponsors (by playing them into your zoo). They either support you directly or fund a project, such as a unique building. Many of them gain you an ongoing effect or income. At the end of the game, you can gain additional appeal or conservation points from your sponsors.

#### X-TOKEN Action (page 18)

If you find yourself in a situation in which you can’t or don’t want to perform any of the 5 actions, you may perform this alternative action to gain exactly 1 X-token. You must still select and move a card to slot 1, shifting all other cards to the right like in other actions. The strength of the slot the card is in does not contribute to this action.

### CARDS I

**Advance the Break token 2 spaces. Then draw cards from the deck OR snap.**

#### DRAWING FROM THE DECK

Compare the strength X of the action with the table on the card. Draw the indicated number of cards (maximum 3) from the deck. Then, you might have to discard a card from your hand, which can be one of the cards you have just drawn or a card already in your hand.

#### SNAPPING

If you execute the action with a strength of at least 5, then instead of drawing several cards from the deck, you may take exactly 1 card from the display into your hand. This is called Snapping. You may take any card, regardless of the reputation of your zoo. Replenish the display at the end of your turn.

Whether you snap or draw from the deck, first advance the Break token 2 steps (do not gain any money for this). You can have any number of cards in your hand after this action, but during the break, you may need to discard cards down to your hand card limit of 3 cards (or 5 with a specific university) (see Break on page 18)

### CARDS II

**Advance the Break token 2 spaces. Then draw cards from the deck or within reputation range OR snap.**

#### DRAWING WITHIN REPUTATION RANGE

If you have upgraded the *Cards* action, you may draw cards within your reputation range, meaning from the display (up to your Reputation counter) and/or from the deck. In addition, the table printed on the card that determines the details of the action is upgraded. You may draw from the display and the deck in any order you choose, but the display is not replenished until you have completed your turn.

#### SNAPPING

If you have upgraded the Cards action, you can snap at a lower strength level, **starting** from a strength of 3. If you choose the snap option, it makes no difference whether the strength is 3 or higher.

In addition, after upgrading your *Cards* action, you may continue progressing past 9 reputation on the Reputation track.

### The Reputation Track and the Display

The game board has a display of 6 cards (see B in the example: Taking cards using side II below). Next to these cards is the Reputation track, where you keep track of the reputation of your zoo (see A in the example: *Taking cards using side II below*).

Whenever you are allowed to increase the reputation of your zoo reputation, advance your counter 1 step on this track. To increase the reputation of your zoo to 10 (or more), you must have upgraded the Cards Action card to **side II**. The TODO icon on space 10 (folder 5) serves as a reminder.

If you advance your Reputation counter to a space with a bonus next to it, you take the bonus immediately and only once. If your counter has reached space 15 on the Reputation track and your zoo keeps receiving reputation, your counter will remain on space 15 and you instead take 1 appeal for each remaining reputation step you are due.

The location of your counter determines which cards in the display are **“within reputation range”** for you. Within reputation range is the card on the same folder as your counter as well as all cards on the lower-numbered folders. This means that the higher your zoo’s reputation, the more cards there are within your reputation range.

If you have taken one or more cards from the display, **do not replenish the display until you have completed your entire turn.** Then, move cards from the higher-numbered folders down to the lower-numbered folders. Do not change the order of the cards. Finally, fill each empty space with a card from the deck.

Next to the display is the **discard pile.** You may **not** look through the discard pile during the game.

### BUILD I

**Build exactly 1 building of your choice with a maximum size of X on your zoo map. Pay 2 money per space. Available: Kiosk, pavilion, standard enclosure, and Petting Zoo.**

The size of a building is measured by the number of spaces it covers on your zoo map. In this action, you have the kiosk (size 1), pavilion (size 1), various standard enclosures (sizes 1–5), and the Petting Zoo (special enclosure size 3) at your disposal. Each zoo can contain **only 1** Petting Zoo. Other buildings can be built more than once. Your zoo map shows an overview of all the buildings. All standard enclosures of each size and all of the different special enclosures have the same shape.

You need **enclosures** to accommodate animals, while **kiosks** grant you income during every break. Each **pavilion** you build immediately (and only once) increases the appeal of your zoo by 1.

Pay the **building cost** into the general supply before placing the building on your zoo map. The cost of a building is twice the number of spaces it will cover, called the size. Therefore, cost = size x2 money.

Build the building **adjacent** to an existing one, meaning at least 1 edge of the new building must touch an edge of an existing one. For your first building, instead, at least 1 space of it must be on a border space of your zoo map.

You may only build on the **empty spaces** of your zoo map. Buildings may not extend beyond the edge of the map, overlap other buildings, or cover water or rock spaces.

You are not allowed to build on spaces with the BUILD II icon yet. To do so, you must first upgrade your *Build* action card.

A **kiosk** must always be at least 3 spaces from every other kiosk on your zoo map, meaning there must always be **at least 2 spaces** between 2 kiosks. The note below the partner zoo space on your zoo map serves as a reminder.

If you cannot build the desired building on your zoo map according to the rules above, you must choose a different building.

Build a standard enclosure with the empty side face-up so that it can still be occupied by an animal later. The empty side has a yellow edge and shows X, where X is the enclosure size. For the Petting Zoo both sides are the same.

If you cover one or more spaces with a Yellow Pentagon, you immediately take the corresponding placement bonus once.

The bonuses are explained on the Icon overview.

### BUILD II

**Build as many different buildings as you like with a maximum total size of X on your zoo map. Newly available: Large Bird Aviary and Reptile House.**

If you have upgraded the Build action, you may also build the special enclosures Large Bird Aviary and Reptile House (both size 5). Just like with the Petting Zoo, each zoo can only accommodate 1 Reptile House and 1 Large Bird Aviary. Both sides of these special enclosures are also the same.

When you build the **Reptile House** or **Large Bird Aviary**, you may **immediately** move animals from a standard enclosure to the new special enclosure. You are not allowed to do this at any other time in the game. Please refer to the Animals action and page 12 specifically for more details on how special enclosures work.

You cannot build unique buildings with this action, they only come into play with the associated Sponsor cards. In addition, you now have the opportunity to build **several** buildings with one action. However, you may not build 2 identical buildings with the same *Build* action, each of them must be different. The total size of these buildings must not exceed X.

Build the buildings on your map **one after the other**. Pay for each building separately before you build it. If you cover a bonus icon, you immediately take the placement bonus before you build the next building. However, do not take any “after finishing” bonuses until the Build action is completed.

Upgrading your *Build* action also allows you to build on the spaces of your zoo map with the BUILD II icon, meaning you can now completely cover your zoo map. If you cover every space of your zoo map, immediately increase the appeal of your zoo by 7. This can happen through the *Build* action, but also through another effect when something is built in your zoo. You must have covered every space on your zoo map, except for the water spaces and rock spaces.

### ANIMALS I

**Play Animal cards from your hand.**

Compare the strength X of the action with the table on the card. Play up to the indicated number of Animal cards from your hand.

Follow the steps below for each animal:

1. **Check conditions:** Any conditions you must fulfill in order to play the Animal card are indicated on the left side of the card. You can only play the card if you fulfill all the conditions (for example, a specific partner zoo or animal category as well as continent icons). The conditions are explained in the Icon overview.
2. **Pay cost:** Pay the cost of the animal indicated in the upper-left corner of the Animal card. If you have a partner zoo on the continent from which the animal originates, this reduces the cost by 3 money per continent icon. Pay the money into the general supply. If you have a card that gains you money for playing the animal, you only take that money in a later step, meaning you must already have enough money beforehand to pay the full cost of the animal.
3. **Fill empty enclosure:** To play an Animal card and accommodate the animal in your zoo, you need free spaces in an enclosure. You can place any animal, except Petting Zoo animals, on its own into an empty standard enclosure. The enclosure must be at least the required size indicated in the upper-left corner of the Animal card. Then flip the enclosure over to its occupied side. Some animals also state that their enclosure needs to be next to one or two water and/or rock spaces. The enclosure requirements of an animal are indicated next to the size of the standard enclosure on the card. Petting Zoo animals cannot be accommodated in a standard enclosure, only in their special enclosure, the Petting Zoo. All reptiles and some birds can be accommodated either in a standard or in a special enclosure, the Reptile House and the Large Bird Aviary, respectively. In that case the card shows two different enclosure requirements, and you can choose whether to put the animal in a standard or special enclosure (for more details see *Special Enclosures* on page 12).
4. **Place Animal card:** Place the Animal card next to your zoo map (see *Placing Cards* on page 13).
5. **Execute effects:** Whenever you play an animal, the appeal of your zoo increases. Advance your counter on the Appeal track the number of steps indicated on the card. Some animals also give you conservation project points or increase the reputation of your zoo. If so, also advance the counters on the corresponding tracks. Many animals have an additional effect when they are played. If the effect text contains “after finishing”, do not execute it until you have finished your entire Animals action. In all other cases, execute the effect immediately, even before playing another Animal card. The same applies to effects from other cards that are triggered by playing your Animal card. If there are multiple simultaneous effects, you choose the order of execution (whether these effects are appeal, reputation, conservation points, or gained by the ability of the animal or from other cards).

> If your group doesn’t like the **interactive effects**, you can instead use the alternate effects intended for the solo game (see Animal Card Layout on this page).

If an action allows you to play 2 Animal cards, play them one after the other and complete all of the above steps for the first animal (except for effects with “after finishing”) before doing the same again for the second animal. You may choose not to play a second Animal card.

Only after that, and after you have moved the Animals Action card to slot 1 of your zoo map, execute the “after finishing” effects. If there are multiple effects of this type, you choose the order of execution.

#### Animal Card Layout

Animal cards represent the different animals you
can accommodate in your zoo.

1. The upper-left corner explains the enclosure requirements you need to fulfill. The number in the hexagon indicates the minimum size enclosure this animal may be placed in.
2. Next to it may appear 1 or 2 rock and/or water icons. This means that the enclosure must be next to at least that many spaces of the depicted type(s).
3. If the animal can also go in a special enclosure, that type, and the spaces the animal occupies, are depicted just to the right of the normal enclosure requirements. The water and rock requirements also apply to the special enclosure.
4. Below the enclosure requirements is the money cost you must pay to play the card and accommodate the animal in your zoo.
5. Below the costs, on the left side, some animals have additional conditions you need to consider.
6. The upper-right corner shows the animal’s category and (except for Petting Zoo animals) the continent from which it originates. These icons interact with all your other cards and are often important for completing conservation projects.
7. The lower-right corner shows the increase in your zoo’s appeal after the animal has been accommodated. Some animals offer additional bonuses such as conservation project points or reputation.
8. Many animals have an effect when played that is either executed immediately or following the Animals action (see Animal Abilities on Glossary pages 2–3.) If the Animal card’s effect refers to an icon that appears on the card itself, that icon counts for the effect.
Some Animal cards have an interactive effect e.g. Venom. This effect can only apply to you if your zoo has 5 or more appeal. The 5 space on the Appeal track is marked as a reminder. See the Glossary for the effect details.
9. Some animals have a different effect in solo play, which is shown in a blue box with the TODO icon.

#### Special Enclosures (Petting Zoo, Reptile House, Large Bird Aviary)

There are 3 different special enclosures: Petting Zoo (1), Reptile House (2), and Large Bird Aviary (3). Your zoo can only have **one** of each type of special enclosure.

Petting Zoo animals cannot be accommodated in a standard enclosure; only in their special enclosure, the Petting Zoo.

All reptiles and some birds can be accommodated either in a standard or in a special enclosure, the Reptile House and the Large Bird Aviary, respectively. In that case the card shows two different enclosure requirements, and you can choose whether to put the animal in a standard or special enclosure. If an animal requires water and/or rock spaces next to its standard enclosure, the same requirement also applies to the respective special enclosure.

If you want to accommodate the animal in a special enclosure, use player tokens from your supply to mark the number of enclosure spaces indicated in the special enclosure icon on the card. If there are not enough free spaces left in the special enclosure, you cannot accommodate the animal there. You never need to flip a special enclosure: Both sides of the tile are the same.

If you build a Reptile House or a Large Bird Aviary and you already have animals in your zoo that could be accommodated there, you may immediately and only this once, move these animals into your corresponding new special enclosure. For each animal you move, find the smallest occupied standard enclosure that meets all of the animal’s enclosure requirements (including water and rock spaces), and flip it back to its empty side. In the rare case there is no such enclosure, flip the smallest occupied standard enclosure that meets at least the animal’s enclosure size requirement. Then mark the special enclosure with the corresponding number of player tokens. If you have several animals that could potentially be moved, you may decide for each animal separately whether you want to move it or not.

### ANIMALS II

**Play Animal cards from your hand or within reputation range.**

If you have upgraded the Animals action, you may play animal cards directly from the display, instead of only from your hand. To do so, the respective card must be within your reputation range. In addition to the cost of the animal, you must pay an amount of money equal to the number on the folder from which you play the Animal card. If you are allowed to play 2 Animal cards, you may choose to play 2 cards from your hand, 2 from the display, or 1 card from your hand and 1 card from the display. Play the animals one after the other. Do not replenish the display until you have finished your turn.

In addition, you may increase the reputation of your zoo by 1, if you perform this action with a strength of at least 5. Increase the reputation at the very beginning of your action, so that your reputation range for this action is already higher. Finally, after upgrading your Animals action, you may also play animals that have the ANIMALS II icon as a condition.

#### Placing Cards

Place your played Sponsor and Animal cards overlapping each other to save space. All information you need for the rest of the game is shown at the top of the card.

Some Sponsor cards have an additional effect at the end of the game. These cards are marked with a vertical brown strip behind the card level (such as on the 2nd card played in this example). This makes cards with endgame effects easier to find once they have been played.

#### Animal categories

There are 7 animal categories in Ark Nova:

* Bird
* Herbivore
* Predator
* Primate
* Reptile
* Bear
* Petting Zoo animal

2 of these 7 categories are special cases, bear and Petting Zoo animal. Thus, in contrast to the other categories, their icon is black on a white background.

The bears are more of a subcategory. Their icon mostly occurs in combination with the herbivore or predator icon. For gameplay reasons, we invented a separate category for Petting Zoo animals, replacing the biological category.

If the game asks for animal categories, this implicitly includes bear and Petting Zoo animals as well. If this is ever not the case, they are explicitly excluded.

### ASSOCIATION I

**Perform exactly one association task.**

To carry out an association task, you need at least 1 active association worker on the notepad of your zoo map. Place this worker on the Association board on the task you want to perform. If 1 of **your** association workers is already on **this** task, you must instead place 2 to perform this task. If 3 of **your** association workers are already on **this** task, you cannot perform it again for the time being. Association workers in colors other than your own do not matter here.

In a break, all your association workers return to your zoo map and become active again. As a result, all the tasks again become available to perform with 1 association worker. More about this in Break on page 18.

Each task requires a different action strength. You can only perform an association task if your action’s strength is at least as high as the task’s value.

#### The various tasks are:

**Increasing reputation:** Increase the reputation of your zoo by 2. Advance your Reputation counter on the Reputation track and receive any bonus shown, if applicable.

The reputation of your zoo determines how many cards you can access in the display (reputation range). In addition, a certain minimum reputation is required to play certain Sponsor cards (see Sponsors action page 17).

**Gaining a partner zoo:** Take a partner zoo from the Association board and place it on the lowest empty partner zoo space on your zoo map. If that space shows a bonus, take it once and immediately. You cannot take a partner zoo that you already have, all your partner zoos must be from different continents. Also, you may take a maximum of 4 partner zoos in total; your zoo map does not have space for a 5th. To take a third (or fourth) partner zoo, you must have upgraded the Association action to side II. If you already have all the partner zoos that are on the Association board at that moment, or if you cannot place the partner zoo on your zoo map, you cannot perform this task. In the break, the supply of partner zoos on the Association board is replenished (see Break page 18).

Each partner zoo reduces the cost of playing all Animal cards from its continent by 3 money per continent icon on the Animal card. It also provides you 1 icon of the respective continent, which may trigger other card effects and may count towards conservation projects. Certain Animal cards require a partner zoo from the same continent.

**Gaining a partner university:** Take a university from the Association board and place it on the lowest available university space of your zoo map. If that space shows a bonus, take it once and immediately. You also advance your Reputation counter accordingly if this is depicted on the university. You cannot take a university you already have. So, if you already have all the universities that are on the Association board at that moment, you cannot perform this task. In the break, the supply of universities on the Association board is replenished (see Break page 18).

Universities increase the reputation of your zoo, grant research icons, and are the only way to increase your hand limit to 5 cards.

> #### The Association Board
>
> The Association board is divided into 2 areas. In the blue area are the tasks that you can perform using your association workers. If you have not upgraded the Association action, you can only perform exactly 1 of these tasks. In the pink area, after upgrading your Association action card, you can gain additional conservation project points by donating to animal conservation organizations. Above and below the Association board are the spaces for the conservation projects that you can support during the game.

**Conservation project work:** You may either support a conservation project already in play or play a Conservation Project card from your **hand** and support it immediately. If you bring a new Conservation Project card into play, place it **above** the Association board on the **leftmost** space. If there is already a conservation project there, move all the Conservation Project cards above the board one place to the right before placing the card. Depending on your player count, there can only be up to 2, 3 or 4 cards above the Association board. If (after placing the new conservation project) there are more cards above the board than is allowed for your player count, put the rightmost card on the discard pile. Return any player tokens on the discarded card to the supply (not to the zoo map) of the corresponding player. The base conservation projects below the Association board are never moved even when they are fully supported. Also no new base conservation projects are added during the game.

To support a conservation project, you must fulfill a condition (depicted on the card) that has no player token on it. You are only allowed to support each conservation project **once**. This means you cannot support a project that already has one of your player tokens on it.

Place 1 player token of your choice **from the left side of your zoo map** on the condition you fulfill, and as a reward advance your Conservation counter and Reputation counter (if applicable) as per the depicted award on the card. If you can fulfill more than one condition, you choose which one. An explanation of the various conservation projects is in the Glossary on page 1.

When you take the player token from your zoo map, you activate the corresponding bonus. You always gain the bonus immediately. With some of them, you also gain the bonus again during each break. Choose whether you take this bonus before or after the reward for the conservation project. The bonuses are explained in the Icon overview.

*Tip: It is sometimes worthwhile to support a conservation project on a lower level, for example in order to get the bonuses on the Conservation track or to activate an income on the left side of your zoo map early in the game.*

#### Conservation Projects Layouts

These cards represent the different conservation projects you can support. Each card depicts 3 conditions to fulfill, as well as the corresponding rewards. Certain Conservation Project cards grant an additional bonus to the player who plays them. There are two types of conservation projects.

In most cases, you must have a certain number of a specific icon in your zoo (in the example to the left, Reptiles). Count the icons on the top edge of all your cards, both on Animal and Sponsor cards (including the water or rock space requirements, but not including the conditions on the left) as well as on your partner zoos and universities.

Conservation projects in which you release an animal into the wild work slightly differently. Instead of collecting a number of icons, you must discard 1 Animal card with a specific icon from your zoo (in this case, Africa A). You choose the matching animal to discard but the animal must require a standard enclosure of the depicted size (B). Whether the animal can also be placed in a special enclosure is irrelevant to the condition. Move your Appeal counter back as many steps as indicated on the Animal card. Remove the appropriate number of player tokens from your special enclosure (if you can) OR flip the smallest occupied standard enclosure that meets the animal’s requirements from the occupied side to the empty side. Place the Animal card on the discard pile. See Glossary page 1 for details to Release into the Wild conservation projects.

### ASSOCIATION II

**Perform one or more different association tasks. You may make one donation.**

If you have upgraded the Association action, you may perform **several different** association tasks with one action. For **each** task, you need 1 or 2 of your association workers. The total value of all association tasks may not exceed the strength of your action. The total value may be less.

If you select to perform conservation project work and support a new Conservation Project card, you may play that card directly from the display. The card you play must be within your reputation range. As an additional cost, you must pay an amount of money equal to the number on the folder from which you play the Conservation Project card. Do not replenish the display until you have completed your turn.

**In addition** to the association tasks, you are allowed to make exactly 1 donation to an animal welfare program. Pay the smallest amount of money visible in the “donation” area into the general supply and then cover the corresponding space with one of your player tokens **from your supply** so that the amount of money on this space is no longer visible. You gain 1 conservation point for this. If all spaces but the last one are occupied by player tokens, each subsequent donation costs 12 money, and you do not have to place any more tokens on that space.

To be able to make a donation, you must have performed at least 1 association task during the same action. You do not need an association worker to make a donation. You can make a maximum of 1 donation per *Association* **action**.

### SPONSORS I

**Play exactly 1 Sponsor card OR advance the Break token and take money**

This action allows you to play **exactly 1** Sponsor card from your hand, provided that the strength of the action is at least equal to the level of the Sponsor card and you meet any conditions on the card (depicted on the left side of the card). Execute the instant effect (if available) and/or the recurring effect of the card (if available and triggered by the icon on this Sponsor card), then place it next to your zoo map.

Alternatively, you can use this action to advance the Break token steps and take money for doing so. You still take money even if the Break token doesn’t need all steps to reach the final space.

### SPONSORS II

**Play one or more Sponsor cards OR advance the Break token and take money.**

If you have upgraded the Sponsors action, you can play **multiple Sponsor cards** with one action. The strength of your action **plus 1** must be at least as high as the sum of the levels on all played cards (remember, with the help of X-tokens you can also increase the beyond 5 ). Play the cards one after the other, meaning you completely execute all the instant effects of one card (except for “after finishing” effects) before playing the next card.

When playing Sponsor cards, you may choose to play them from the **display** or your hand. Any cards played from the display must be within your reputation range. Pay an additional amount of money equal to the number on the folder from which you play the Sponsor card. Do not replenish the display until you have completed your turn. If you use the Sponsors action to advance the Break token, you take money **twice**.

Finally, after upgrading your Sponsors action, you may also play Sponsor cards that have the SPONSORS II icon as a condition.

#### Sponsor cards Layout

(1) The level for each Sponsor card is in its upper-left corner. (2) If the card lets you place a special building in your zoo, and this building must be built next to water or rocks, this requirement is shown next to the level (where it would also be on Animal cards). (3) Any conditions that you must fulfill in order to play the card are shown on the left side of the card. (4) If the card itself provides a icon, it is depicted in the upper-right corner.

Sponsor cards can have a variety of different effects. (5) If the card has a recurring effect, this is shown at the top of the card on a blue background, unless it gives you income during every break, in which case the background is purple.

(6) A one-off effect when playing the card is indicated by a yellow background in the lower-left corner of the card. (7) An effect during the final scoring is indicated by a brown background in the lower-right corner of the card. A vertical brown strip behind the card level (1) serves as a reminder that this card has an effect in the final scoring (in case you place the cards overlapping each other).

If an effect on a Sponsor card refers to an icon that appears on the Sponsor card itself, this icon counts for the effect or for triggering the effect. However, only the icons in the upper-right corners of cards (4) are used, not those anywhere else on the card, except for the rock and water icons, which are in the upper-left corner.

(8) Some effects are already explained on the Sponsor card itself; all card effects are explained on Glossary pages 4–7.

### X-TOKEN

**Take 1 X-token.**

If you cannot or do not want to perform any of the 5 actions, you can still use this alternative action and take 1 X-token. You can perform this action using any Action card. It is independent of the value of the card’s slot and you cannot use X-tokens to increase the strength of the action. It doesn’t matter whether the Action card has been upgraded.

You must still select an Action card, move it to slot 1, and shift the intervening cards to the right. Then, take an X-token. If you already have 5 X-tokens, you cannot perform this action.

#### Appeal and Conservation Points

During the game you increase the appeal of your zoo and
collect conservation points. This is necessary to win and also
helps you during the game.

The appeal of your zoo determines how much money you
earn in each break.

Additionally, there are 4 spaces on the Conservation track
that provide an immediate one-time effect when you reach
or pass them. Those spaces are the following:

* **2 conservation points:** **Either** upgrade one of your Action cards (flip it over) **or** activate an additional association worker (take a lying down worker from the lowest space below the notepad and place it onto the notepad). Either option is available to each player who reaches space 2.
* **5 / 8 conservation points:** Take **either** 5 money **or** one of the bonus tokens next to this space on the Conservation track. Execute the effect (money or Bonus token) immediately. If you take a Bonus token, remove it from the game afterwards. The option to take 5 money remains even after both Bonus tokens are gone.
* **10 conservation points:** The **first time** a player reaches, or exceeds, 10 Conservation Points, **all players** choose and discard one of their Final Scoring cards. Place them facedown under the pile of remaining Final Scoring cards. If no one accrues 10 Conservation Points before the game ends, all players must choose and discard a Final Scoring card before end game scoring can begin.

#### Break

Ark Nova does not follow a fixed round system. You take turns, taking 1 turn at a time, until the Break token has advanced to the last space of the Break track . An Action card, Sponsor card, or Animal card effect could cause this to happen. If you trigger the break, complete your current turn, take the Break token, and then all players perform the following steps in order:

1. **Hand card limit:**
If you have more cards in your hand than your hand limit allows, discard any surplus cards of your choice from your hand to the discard pile. Normally your hand limit is 3, but a particular university allows you to hold 5.
2. **Tokens on Action cards:**
If you have Multiplier, Venom, and/or Constriction tokens on your Action cards, return them to the supply. They no longer have any effect.
3. **Association board:**
Return all your association workers from the Association board to the notepad on your zoo map. They become available to you again as active workers. Replenish the display of partner zoos and universities so that exactly one of each partner zoo and university is now available again.There is no need to replenish universities and partner zoos that all players already have.
4. **Replenish display:**
Discard the two bottom cards of the display (folders 1 and 2) to the discard pile, move the remaining cards down and replenish the display. The icon on folders 1 and 2 serves as a reminder.
5. **Take income:**
Most of the time, all players can take their income simultaneously. Some effects may require this to happen in player order, such as multiple players having an effect that allows them to take a card from the display. In these situations, affected players should take income in clockwise order starting from the player who initiated the Break. The display is replenished after each player.
  a. Collect income according to the **appeal** of your zoo. Take the amount of money indicated next to your counter on the Appeal track.
   *Example: If your counter is on space 7 of the Appeal track, take 11 money.*
  b. Collect income for the **kiosks** on your zoo map. Check each kiosk on your zoo map separately. Take 1 money for each unique building, special enclosure, **occupied** standard enclosure, and pavilion adjacent to it. A building must share at least one side of one space with a kiosk in order to be considered adjacent to it. An empty standard enclosure does not provide income (but an empty special enclosure does).
  c. Collect all the **income** indicated by the following icon: HAND. The icon appears on some Sponsor cards and in some bonuses on the left side of your zoo map. Take only the bonuses on your zoo map that you have already activated (those you have uncovered by placing the player token on a conservation project).
6. **Break track:**
Return the Break token to the starting space for your player count. Then the break ends, and the game continues with the next
player in clockwise order taking their next turn.

## END OF GAME & FINAL SCORING

### 1.Game end

If at the end of your turn or during a break your **Conservation counter** and **Appeal counter** are ever in the **same scoring area**, or if they have passed one another, the end of the game is triggered. Each **scoring area** comprises one space of the Conservation track and the adjacent spaces of the Appeal track. If the end of the game is triggered at the end of **your turn**, all other players (but not you) will take one more turn. The next time it would be your turn, move on to final scoring instead. If the end of the game is triggered **during a break**, all players (including you) will take one more turn.

### 2.Score cards

At the end of the game, you still get conservation points or appeal from your **Final Scoring card(s)**, as well as from all your cards with an end-of-game icon. Remember, if no player reached 10 conservation points, all players should discard one of their Final Scoring cards before adding these points to their totals.

### 3.Determine Victory Points

Finally, it’s time to tally Victory Points. Begin by looking at the scoring area where your conservation counter is located. Find the lowest appeal value in that scoring area. This is your Target Number. Compare your Target Number to the value of your appeal counter. Subtract your Target Number from your appeal value and the result is your Victory Points. The player with the **highest positive Victory Point** total is the winner. In case of a tie, the tied player who supported the most Conservation Projects wins the game (you can determine this by counting how many player tokens have been removed from left side of your zoo map). If the score is still a tie, all tied players share the victory.

> You may have noticed that in order to have a positive score, your appeal counter and conservation counter have to cross one another! Keep that in mind as you make decisions to maximize your score!

### Final Scoring Card Layout

Each Final Scoring card uses either a table (below, left) or text (below, right) to indicate how you can gain 1–4 additional Conservation Points at the end of the game. For scoring purposes, consider your universities and the cards in front of you and the icons on them. You can never gain more than 4 conservation points from a single Final Scoring card.

## SOLO GAME

If you play Ark Nova on your own, modify the rules as follows:

### Setup

* Lay out 3 basic Conservation Project cards and do **not** place any tokens of a different color on them (i.e. like a 3-player setup).
* Do not use the Break token. Instead, place 7 player tokens of any unused color on the spaces in the left column of the solo tile.
* You start the game with 20 appeal.

### Turn / Cards

Cards with interactive effects have a blue stripe at the bottom with the TODO icon; the contents of the blue stripe replace the card’s interactive effect with an appropriate solo effect. You will find this feature on 1 Final Scoring card and a number of Animal cards.

There can be up to 2 Conservation Project cards above the Association board.

If you perform an action that would advance the Break token, it simply doesn’t. If you would take money for moving it, you still get the money. You do not get an X-token for triggering a break (see Gameplay / Breaks to the right).

*Examples: You play the Cougar with the ability Jump 3. Although there is no Break token to advance, you still take 3 money.*

*You use the upgraded Sponsors action with a strength X of 4 for the break ability. Although there is no Break token to advance, you still take 8 money.*

### Gameplay / Breaks

Every time you end a turn, move the topmost player token in the left column of the solo tile onto the space to its right (in the right column) (1). If you move the last token from the left column into the right column (2) (and thus reveal the break icon), you immediately resolve a break.

At the beginning of the break, place the topmost player token onto the open donation space with the smallest number on the Association board (3) (if all the other spaces, except for space 12, are already occupied place it next to space 12, even if this has no effect on the donations) and move the remaining tokens back into the left column of the solo tile (but now 1 more row is empty).

Then perform all steps of a break except for step 6.

The game ends after 6 rounds, when only 2 tokens are left on the solo tile and you moved the bottom one to the right. Do not trigger another break, but do the final scoring instead.

If you have **at least** 0 Victory Points after the final scoring (meaning both your Appeal counter and Conservation counter have reached the same scoring area or passed each other), you have won the solo game.

### Difficulty Levels / Solo Challenge

We recommend that **beginners** start the solo game with an appeal of **20**. Depending on your experience, you could instead start the game with **10** or even **0** appeal. Starting the solo game with 0 appeal is quite a challenge! Feel free to play as many games as you like at each difficulty level.

As a **special challenge**, play 3 games in a row. In this case, do not shuffle the cards after each game. Instead, remove all cards from that particular game (discard pile, display, all of your cards, and all of the conservation projects) and set up the game with the remaining cards. Also remove the two zoo maps you had to choose from, as well as the 4 Bonus tiles. For the third game, you will have to reuse a random 3 of the removed Bonus tiles.

You no longer have access to the cards that are out of play, with the only exception being the animal abilities Assertion and *Dominance*.

At the end of each game, record your score; then total all 3 scores at the very end. If the sum is at least 0 (i. e. not negative) you have passed the challenge!
