***Explore, Settle, Develop, Trade, Consume, or Produce? Which do you need the most?  
Which of Earth’s former colonies will be most successful at settling the galaxy, now that JumpDrive exists? Who will discover the secrets of the mysteriously vanished Alien Overlords?  
Your goal: to build the most prosperous and powerful space empire!***

## OVERVIEW

In ***Race for the Galaxy***, players build galactic civilizations by game cards that represent worlds or technical and social developments.

Each round consists of one or more of five possible ***phases***. In each round, each player secretly and simultaneously chooses one of seven different ***action cards*** and then reveals it. Only the selected phases occur. For these phases, every player performs the phase’s ***action***, while the selecting player(s) also get a ***bonus*** for that phase.

For example, if at least one player chooses the ***Develop*** action, then the ***Develop*** phase will occur; otherwise it is skipped. In it, each player may simultaneously select a development from his hand of cards to build. After revealing the cards, each player adds his development to his ***tableau*** of cards on the table and then discards cards from his hand equal to its cost. Each player who chose ***Develop*** discards one card fewer as his bonus.

***Explore*** allows a player to draw cards and select which of them to add to his hand. ***Settle*** allows a player to place a world in his tableau. Some worlds produce ***goods***, represented by face down cards, when ***Produce*** is selected. These goods can be discarded for victory points or sold to add cards to the player’s hand by selecting ***Consume***. With cards, players can settle new worlds and build more developments, gaining both victory points and ***card powers*** that provide advantages in certain phases.

The player who best manages his cards, phase and bonus selections, and card powers to build the greatest space empire, wins.

**The winner is the player with the most victory points.**

## CONTENTS

***Some cards in the three decks have been presorted for your very first game (see Setup). Unpack the card decks carefully.***

* 5 start world cards (numbered “0” to “4” in red or blue squares in their upper left and lower right corners)
* 109 game cards (like start worlds, these have the title on back)
  * 59 worlds (with **Circle** symbols)
  * 50 developments (with **Diamond** symbols)
* 4 sets of 7 player action cards (used to select phases and bonuses each round; these have no title on their brightly colored backs)
* 8 duplicate action cards for experienced 2-player games
* 4 summary sheets
* 28 Victory Point (VP) chips: 18 @ 1, 6 @ 5, and 4 @ 10

***Carefully remove the VP chips from their frame before your first game.***

## SETUP

Place 12 victory point (VP) chips per player in **1** and **5 VP chips** nearby. Set aside the **10 VP chips** (and any left over chips) for use only during the final round of play.

Each player takes a set of seven *different* **action cards**.

Find and shuffle the five **start worlds**. Deal one world face up to each player. These form each player’s initial card *tableau*.

> **Your first game:** instead, for two players, use start worlds 1 and 2; for three, use start worlds 1-3; and, for four, use start worlds 1-4.

Shuffle the unused start worlds together with the **game cards**. Deal six face down cards to each player. Each player then examines these cards and discards two cards face down to the discard pile. The remaining game cards form the initial *card supply*.

> **Your first game:** instead, each player uses the four *numbered* game cards matching his start world’s number as his initial (preset) hand. After finding these preset hand cards, shuffle all the remaining game cards, including any left over start worlds and preset hand cards, together.
>
> The start worlds, preset hands, and action card sets for your very first game have already been presorted by the printer.

If ***Alpha Centauri*** is in play, place a card from the card supply face down on top of it (as its starting windfall good).

## PLAYING THE GAME

A game is played over several rounds (typically 7 to 11). At the start of a round, each player simultaneously and secretly chooses one action card, placing it face down in front of himself. Once all players have done so, they turn these action cards face up. Then, the players perform the selected phases in order (I: Explore; II: Develop; III: Settle; IV: Consume; V: Produce), omitting every phase not chosen by at least one player.

Each phase has an *action*, which is performed by *all* players. In addition, the players who chose that phase get a *bonus*.

**Important:** if more than one player chooses the same phase, its action is still only performed *once* (with all the players who selected that phase receiving a bonus).

The bonus for an action either modifies it (such as reducing its cost or doubling the VPs gained) or is in addition to it (such as a card draw afterwards or the opportunity to sell a good).

Players may find it useful to turn over the action card(s) for each phase as it is completed before performing the next one. New players may find it useful to place the selected action cards in the center in numerical order. As players become more familiar with the phase order, this won’t be necessary.

After all phases chosen that round have been performed, each player must discard down to ten (game) cards in his hand and then reclaims the action card that he or she played that round.

Successive rounds are performed in the same manner until an end-of-game condition is met (see *Game End* below).

Game cards have three uses: as a ***development*** or ***world*** to be placed in a player’s tableau; as ***one wealth*** to discard from one’s hand face down when paying to place a development or world; or as a ***good*** placed face down on a world either upon it being settled or during production.

## I: EXPLORE

Action: each player draws two cards and then *simultaneously* selects which one of them to add to his hand, discarding the other card face down in the center discard area.

All cards drawn are dealt out before any cards are discarded.

There are ***two*** possible ***Explore*** bonuses, depending on which ***Explore*** action card was chosen by a player.

A player who chose ***Explore: +5*** draws five more cards to select from before making his choice. Such a player explores by drawing 7 cards and choosing 1 of them to add to his hand.

A player who chose Explore: +1,+1 draws one more card to select from and keeps another card. Such a player explores by drawing 3 cards and choosing 2 of them to add to his hand.

Thus, depending on the bonus chosen with the Explore action, a player can either have more cards to select from or gain an extra card to keep.

The ***powers*** of various cards can alter these rules if a player has them in his tableau, possibly providing extra card draws or allowing a player to keep additional cards.

## II: DEVELOP

Action: each player places a development card from his hand face down, or no card if a player doesn’t intend to place a development. Once all players have done so, they ***simultaneously*** turn them face up and then pay for them.

If desired, players can put their intended developments (if any) under their action card, revealing them when everyone is ready.

Each development has a **Diamond** symbol containing its ***cost***, ranging from 1–6. To pay for a development, a player discards cards equal to this number face down from his hand.

Players who chose ***Develop***, as the bonus, discard one card fewer than the development’s cost. If, due to special powers, a player is already discarding no cards, no bonus is received.

A player may not build a given development if another copy of it is currently in his tableau.

Next to a development’s diamond is its victory point (VP) value. It adds to the player’s final victory point total at the end of the game.

6-cost developments have **<?>** listed as their victory point values. These are worth a variable number of victory points at the end of the game, as indicated on these cards.

The ***powers*** of various cards can alter these rules if a player has them in his tableau ***before*** the development phase begins.

## CARD POWERS

Every development, and most worlds, list one or more ***powers***. ***Standard powers*** are depicted by icons with no text description (see the reference sheet). ***Special powers*** have icons, highlighted phases, and text descriptions at the bottom of the card which begin with the corresponding phase number.

All powers modify rules and are cumulative. A power modifies only the rules listed in its description; all other rules still apply.

“Draw” — in all phases except ***Explore*** — means draw a card and add it to your hand. In ***Explore***, it means draw a card and add it to the cards you then select from, as in the ***Explore*** rules.

If, due to powers, a cost is reduced below 0, it becomes 0. A player does not receive cards as a “refund” if this occurs.

A power does not take effect in the ***phase*** in which its card is placed; it can begin to take effect as soon as the ***next*** phase.

Thus, the ***Public Works*** power to draw one card after its owner builds a development does not apply to ***Public Works*** itself.

Unless a power’s description uses the word “may”, a power ***must*** be used, if possible, in the phase to which it applies (though a player may freely choose the order in which to invoke powers, as discussed further under ***Consume***).

An optional power (such as a ***Colony Ship***) ***must*** be used if it is needed to place a development or world which a player has selected and then revealed.

Powers are resolved sequentially (even though their effects can be cumulative). A player cannot “interrupt” one power with another.

## III: SETTLE

Action: each player places a world card from his hand face down, or no card if a player doesn’t intend to place a world. Once all players have done so, they ***simultaneously*** turn them face up and then pay for (or conquer) them.

Many worlds contain a black number, ranging from 0-6, in a black circle; this is the world’s ***cost***. To pay for such worlds, the player discards cards face down from his hand equal to this number.

Players who chose ***Settle***, as the bonus, draw one card after placing and paying for (or conquering) a world.

Beside a world’s circle is its victory point value. This adds to the player’s final victory point total at the end of the game.

The ***powers*** of various cards can alter the settle rules if a player has them in his tableau ***before*** the settle phase begins.

**Windfalls:** some worlds have a colored “halo” around their circle, showing that they are ***windfall worlds*** and that a good is to be put on them when they are first settled. To do so, as part of placing the world in a player’s tableau, he takes a card face down — without looking at it — from the card supply and puts it on top of the world’s lower right portion (to avoid hiding the world’s VPs and powers). This card represents a ***good*** of the ***kind*** indicated by the ***color*** of the world’s halo.

There are four ***kinds*** of goods in the game:

* ***Alien technology***, artifacts left by the vanished Alien Overlords.
* ***Genes***, genetic material used in biological research.
* ***Rare elements***, transuranic elements powering JumpDrive.
* ***Novelty goods***, such as artwork and entertainment.

**Military Conquest:** some worlds have red circles and, within them, a red outlined number, ranging from 1–7; this is the world’s ***defense***. These worlds ***cannot*** be placed by payment, but instead must be ***conquered***. To conquer a world, a player’s total ***Military*** must equal or exceed the world’s defense. Then, the player simply places it — and its ***windfall*** good, if it has a halo — without paying for it (and then draws a bonus card if that player chose ***Settle***).

Military is granted by powers of various start worlds, developments, or worlds, and lasts until the end of the settle phase.

Some developments and worlds, such as the Empath World, subtract from a player’s total Military.

***New Military Tactics*** may be discarded from a player’s tableau for +3 Military until the end of that settle phase.

A ***Contact Specialist*** enables a player to place and pay for a military world (except an ***Alien*** military world), at a cost equal to one less than the world’s defense.

**Important:** this cost is ***not*** reduced by a player’s Military (Military and payments ***never*** combine).

Cost discounts from ***Replicant Robots***, ***Mining Robots***, etc. ***do*** combine with a ***Contact Specialist*** to reduce the cost of placing a military world. Similarly, a ***Colony Ship*** allows a ***Contact Specialist*** to place a (non-***Alien***) military world at no cost.

Thus, there are two ***completely separate*** ways to place military worlds.

## IV: CONSUME

Action: all players ***must*** use their consume powers to discard goods for victory point ***chips*** and/or card draws.

Some powers consume several goods. Others consume goods of a specific ***kind***. Some, such as ***Deficit Spending***, consume ***cards***, not goods, discarded from a player’s hand. A few powers, such as ***New Economy***, don’t involve discarding anything; they simply take effect during a ***Consume*** phase.

Goods are discarded face down (without examining them). Each good being discarded applies to only one consume power. A good may or may not be on the world consuming it.

Consumption is mandatory. However, consume powers can be invoked in any desired order, even if this results in some unconsumed goods left over that could have been consumed with a different order (due to their ***kinds*** not matching the player’s remaining unused consume powers).

Each consume power can be used only once in a consume phase. Some powers allow multiple goods, “up to” some number, to be discarded, with each good producing an effect. Such powers must be fully used, if possible, when invoked.

Thus, a player with a tableau containing three novelty goods, ***New Vinland*,** and ***Free Trade Association***, cannot consume two goods using ***FTA***’s power (to consume up to 3 novelty goods for 1 VP and a card apiece) and then, based on the cards received, decide to consume the third novelty good using ***New Vinland***’s power (to consume a good for two cards). The third novelty good must now be consumed by ***FTA***.

(These powers could have been invoked in the reverse order, but this choice must be made ***before*** invoking ***FTA***’s power — once a power is invoked, its resolution cannot be interrupted by another power.)

There are two possible ***Consume*** bonuses, depending on which ***Consume*** action card was chosen by a player.

**$: Trade:** players who chose ***Consume: Trade*** must sell one good (before applying their
consume powers), by discarding it and drawing a number of cards that depends on the kind of
good sold: ***Alien*** technology: 5 cards; ***Genes***: 4 cards; ***Rare*** elements: 3 cards; or ***Novelty***: 2 cards.

***Only*** players who chose ***Consume: Trade*** can sell a good.

Players choosing ***Consume: Trade*** also apply all relevant ***Trade*** special powers (listed next to ***$***) to this sale (typically, to draw extra cards).

Players who chose ***Consume: 2x VPs*** double the number of victory point chips — but not any other effects — that their consume powers provide.

Exception: VPs for discarding cards from your hand (from powers such as ***Deficit Spending*** or ***Merchant World***) are not doubled by this bonus.

## V: PRODUCE

Action: place a ***good*** on each ***production world*** (worlds with colored, solid circles) **without a good**, by taking a card face down — without looking at it — from the card supply and putting it on top of the world’s lower right portion (to avoid hiding the world’s VPs and powers). This good is of the ***kind*** indicated by the ***color*** of the world’s solid circle.

No world can have more than one good. Place a good on the lower right portion of a world to avoid hiding the world’s VPs or powers. Some worlds, such as ***Gem World***, provide a card draw as part of producing a good. If a good is already present, then ***no*** cards are drawn.

Players who chose ***Produce***, as the bonus, produce a good (if possible) on one of their windfall worlds that does not already have a good.

Some cards, such as ***Genetics Lab***, can also produce goods on windfall worlds (without goods).

Others, such as the ***Pan-Galactic League***, provide a card draw for each world of a specific ***kind*** in a player’s tableau (such as ***Genes*** worlds, with either a green halo or a green solid circle).

## ROUND END, CARDS, AND CHIPS

After all chosen phases are done, players must discard down to 10 (game) cards before starting the next round.

All discards are ***face down***. Keep the discard pile a bit “messy” so that it is not confused with the card supply.

When the card supply is exhausted, immediately reshuffle the discards to form a new card supply.

All players’ VP chips and the ***number*** of game cards they have in their hands are open for examination. Make change among VP chips as needed.

## GAME END

The game ends at the ***end*** of the round (including discarding) in which:

* a player has 12 or more cards in his card tableau, **or** (A player can end with more than 12 cards in his card tableau by placing both a development and a world in the final round.)
* the last victory point chip is given out.

If victory point chips run out, add the 10 VP chips and make change so that all victory points earned in the final consume phase can be taken.

Total each player’s development and world VPs, VP chips, and any end of game VPs for 6-cost <?> developments.

The player with the highest total is the winner!

If two or more players tie, the player among them with the highest total number of cards in hand (after discarding) and goods on worlds wins.

If there is still a tie, then all the tied players win.

## TIMING

Mostly, play can and should be performed simultaneously.

However, there are a few cases where player order can matter, such as:

* when there are only a few cards left in the card supply, or
* when the VP chips might run out in a Consume phase, or
* when players are settling near the end of the game.

Near the end of the game, if several players have ***New Military Tactics*** or ***Colony Ships***, a player may wish to know whether another player is using (and discarding) one of these cards ***or*** placing a twelfth card in his tableau (thus ending the game that round), before deciding whether to use one of these cards himself.

In this and similar cases, perform the phase in clockwise order, starting with the player who has the lowest numbered (original) start world.

## 2 PLAYER GAME (for experienced players)

Initially, two players should just play the standard rules. Once you’re familiar with the game, play with the following changes:

* Each player uses a full set of nine action cards and chooses ***two*** of them at the start of each round.
* A player selecting both ***Explore*** bonuses draws eight cards and keeps  two of them (plus the effects of any applicable powers).
* If a player chooses either two ***Develop*** or two ***Settle*** actions, then ***two complete, sequential phases*** of that type occur (with this player receiving a bonus in each of them). If his opponent also chose one of these same actions, then his opponent receives a bonus only for the ***first*** of these two phases. Powers placed in the first such phase ***can*** be used in the second one.
* A player who selects both ***Consume*** bonuses must sell one good before consuming other goods for double VPs.
