# Gloomhaven: Buttons & Bugs Rulebook

## Table of Contents

### Getting Started

***Gloomhaven: Buttons & Bugs*** is a tactical combat game for one player. You will play as a mercenary in a series of scenarios that make up an exciting campaign story.

Despite coming in a tiny package, this is a big game! This guide will teach you the basics to get you playing quickly. For the full rules, read the digital rulebook.

Start by taking the deck of **scenario cards** from the box. Then flip over the top card and read the story of **That Shrinking Feeling**.

Before you begin, you will need to choose a character. There are six available characters, each described on the back of their respective character card.

## Character Setup

This guide will be using the **Bruiser**. If you are new to the world of Gloomhaven, we recommend using the Bruiser to follow along. Gather the following:

* Your **character card** and the matching **miniature**.
* The brown **hit point dial**, set to your character’s maximum hit point value for level 1, shown on your character card.
* The four level 1 **ability cards** listed on the back of your character card. These are double-sided and start on their **A-side**.
* Your brown **character attack modifier tray**. Place a white cube in the topmost slot.

## Scenario Setup

It’s time to read **Scenario 1: A Rude Welcome**, the next card in the scenario deck.

Read the scenario entry up to and including the goal.

Retrieve the Bandit Guard monster card, noted in the scenario entry’s monster list.

Flip the scenario card over to its map side. Some hexes have terrain with special rules, defined by their colored border.

Neither you nor enemies can move through obstacles, but you can attack through them with ranged attacks.

Hazards will hurt anyone that moves into them. These hazards deal 1 damage each time the hex is entered.

Take note of the quantity and cube colors of the monsters shown on the map.

Place cubes in the map hexes with Bandit Guard artwork: a green cube in the hex marked with the green cube and a blue cube in its corresponding hex.

Place your miniature in the starting hex.

Retrieve a **monster tray** and place the Bandit Guard card in the card slot.

Set the bandits’ maximum hit points, as shown on their monster card, on the **hit point dials** that match their cube color.

Place a white cube in the middle **○** slot of the monster tray.

Retrieve the red **monster modifier tray** and place a white cube in the topmost slot.

Keep the **condition tokens**, **icon reference card**, and **die** nearby for later use.

## Playing a Scenario

Each scenario is played over a series of **rounds**, and each round consists of the following steps:

1. **Card Selection:** First, pick two of your ability cards to play during the round.
2. **Ordering of Initiative:** Next, determine the order in which you and the monsters will take turns.
3. **Character and Monster Turns:** Finally, carry out the turns in the order determined by initiative, from lowest to highest.

These rounds continue until the scenario goal is reached or your character becomes exhausted.

Before you play the first round, there are a few important concepts to understand. First, we need to go over actions and abilities.

The entire top or bottom half of each of your cards is a single **action**. On your turn, you will perform the **top action** of one of the cards you picked for the round and the **bottom action** of the other.

Each action consists of one or more **abilities** represented by icons and numbers.

The two most common abilities are **Move** and **Attack**. These two abilities are so important that you can choose to forego any card’s top action to instead perform a basic **Attack 2** ability or forego any bottom action to perform a basic **Move 2** ability.

### MOVE

When you perform a **Move** ability, you can move a number of hexes up to the value of the ability. For example, with a basic **Move 2**, you can move two hexes, moving to an adjacent hex with each movement point.

### ATTACK

An **Attack** ability allows you to target an adjacent enemy and deal damage equal to the ability’s value modified by an **attack modifier** roll.

Any time you perform an attack, roll the die and apply the corresponding modifier from the chart on your modifier tray.

The applied modifier comes from the **column** of the die result and the row marked by the white cube.

For example, if you perform a basic **Attack 2** and roll a **+** result while the cube marks the third row, the attack will deal 3 damage (2 from the attack value and +1 from the rolled modifier).

Most modifiers simply add or subtract a value, but there are two unique modifiers. The **Ø** reduces the final attack value to zero, while the **2x** doubles the total value.

**Important: After each attack, move the cube down one slot in the modifier tray (or back to the top slot if it is at the bottom).**

Sometimes you will have **advantage** or **disadvantage** on your attacks. When you do, roll the die **twice** and use the better or worse modifier, respectively. If you would have both, just roll once as normal.

## Additional Abilities

Aside from move and attack, there are a few other abilities and added effects on the Bruiser’s cards to cover.

### JUMP

Movement with **Jump** allows you to safely move through hazards and obstacles. You cannot end your movement on an obstacle, and you still suffer the effects of a hazard that you stop on.

### RANGE

An attack with **Range** allows you to target an enemy at a distance up to the range value. However, a ranged attack against an adjacent target will have disadvantage.

### AREA OF EFFECT

An **area of effect** attack can affect multiple targets. Roll a separate modifier for each one.

The gray hex indicates your position relative to the red **target hexes**. If an area does not include a gray hex, at least one target hex must be within range, but the area can be rotated or mirrored.

### CONDITIONS

A **condition** ability applies the listed condition to the indicated target (or the target of an attack if listed as an attack effect). Each condition’s effect is described on the icon reference card.

Place applied condition tokens on your character card or, for a targeted monster, next to its health dial.

### PIERCE

An attack with **Pierce** ignores an amount of the target’s shield bonus up to the value of the pierce.

### SHIELD

**Shield** is an active bonus that negates damage from each attack that targets you. The damage negated is equal to the shield value.

An **active bonus** lasts until the end of the round or even longer. Such actions are marked with an icon in the lower-right corner.

A **round bonus**  lasts until the end of the round while a **persistent bonus** lasts until you choose to end it. Place cards with active bonuses above your character card in the active area.

### PUSH

**Push** allows you to move the target a number of spaces up to the push value. Each space moved must increase the range to the target by one.

On the Bruiser’s Warding Strength card, the push is applied to the target of the attack.

### ELEMENTS

Ignore elements, such as the **wind** on the Bruiser’s Leaping Cleave card, for now. We’ll explain them in a bit.

---

There is still more to learn, but let’s put some of this into practice first. It’s time to begin the first round of the scenario.

## 1. Card Selection

At the start of each round, you’ll pick two cards from your hand, which you’ll play during the round. Do so now.

**Important: You will perform the top action of one card and the bottom action of the other, but you do not have to decide which actions to perform yet.**

For example, as the Bruiser, you could pick **Shield Bash** and **Warding Strength** with the intent to move adjacent to the green bandit with the bottom action of Shield Bash and then attack with the top action of Warding Strength, pushing the bandit into the hazard and strengthening yourself.

## 2. Ordering of Initiative

After picking your two cards, choose the **initiative value** of one of them. This determines when you will take your turn during the round. The lower your initiative, the sooner you act.

Next, you’ll determine the initiative of the Bandit Guards. Roll the die and move the white cube on the monster tray to the slot matching the die result. The column below the cube indicates the bandits’ initiative and what abilities they will perform this round. Both bandits will perform these same abilities.

If their initiative value is lower than yours, they will act before you this round.

## 3. Character and Monster Turns

The rest of the round consists of your turn and the monsters’ turns. Whoever has the lower initiative will act first.

### CHARACTER TURNS

On your turn, you’ll perform the **top action** of one of your chosen cards and the **bottom action** of the other. You can perform either action first.

After finishing an action, flip the card to its **B-side** and return it to your hand. If the action has an active bonus icon, instead place it into your active area above your character card for now.

Track damage you suffer by reducing your current hit points on your hit point dial.

### MONSTER TURNS

On a monster’s turn, it performs the abilities listed below the white cube. Each monster of the same type performs the same actions, but they take their turns in numeric order.

Monsters perform only the abilities listed. If a move ability isn’t listed, they will not move.

Monsters perform abilities in the same way that you do, following some additional guidelines.

### MONSTER MOVEMENT

Monsters move along the shortest path to their target (you) without moving into hazards. They will choose a path around hazards even if it means they cannot get in range to attack on their turn.

### MONSTER DAMAGE

When a monster suffers damage, track the damage on the hit point dial of the corresponding color. As soon as a monster has zero hit points, it dies.

When a monster dies, remove its cube from the map and remove any conditions it had suffered.

### MONSTER ACTIVE BONUSES

Persistent bonuses listed along the bottom of the monster card—such as the bandit guards’ **Shield 1**—are active at all times.

Round bonuses from rolled abilities are only active once the monster has taken its turn, but they remain active until the end of the round.

Multiple active bonuses stack. For example, if the cube on the monster tray marks the leftmost column, the Bandit Guards have a **Shield 1** round bonus once the bandits have taken their turn. This shield value is added to their persistent bonus, temporarily giving each bandit **Shield 2**.

## End of Round

After you and the bandits have taken your turns, the round will end.

Cards in your active area with **round bonuses** are now flipped to their B-side and returned to your hand. **Persistent bonuses** can stay in your active area.

You should now have two **A-side** cards and two **B-side** cards in your hand (unless you have a persistent bonus active, in which case you’ll have only one B-side card).

Before you start the second round, let’s learn about the effects of your B-side cards.

### B-SIDE CARDS

**B-side** cards in your hand can be picked at the start of the round just like **A-side** cards. However, instead of flipping them after use, B-side cards are **discarded** and cannot be used again until recovered.

### TARGET

An ability with a **Target** specifies the target or targets affected. If only a number is given, you can target up to that many enemies within the ability’s range.

### RETALIATE

**Retaliate** is an active bonus that allows you to deal damage to an enemy that attacks you. The damage dealt is equal to the retaliate value.

Like shield, retaliate can be gained as a round bonus or persistent bonus.

### LOST ACTIONS

After performing an action with the **lost icon**, place the card in your lost pile, to the right of your character card, where it remains until the end of the scenario.

If the lost action has an active bonus, the card is still considered lost and must be moved to the lost pile when its active bonus ends.

### NEGATING DAMAGE

When you suffer damage, you may negate the damage by discarding or losing cards in one of three ways:

1. **Discard** one A-side card from your **hand**.
2. **Discard** two B-side cards from your hand.
3. **Lose** one card from your **discard pile**.

### ELEMENTS

Elemental infusions, such as the **wind** on Bruiser’s **Leaping Cleave** card, can empower some effects.

As long as an infusion is visible on a card in your hand, active area, or one of your chosen cards, it can be consumed once each round.

The option to **consume** an
element is represented by an
element icon marked with
**X** and followed by the added
effect after a colon (“:”).

For example, during the attack ability of the Bruiser’s **Skewer** card, you can consume wind to add **+1 Attack** and **Pierce 2** to the entire attack ability.

### HEAL

A **Heal** allows the target to regain hit points equal to the heal value. For example, the Bruiser’s **Eye for an Eye** card can heal you 2 hit points.

## Resting

There are two ways to rest—short rest and long rest—and both allow you to retrieve cards from your discard pile at the cost of losing one card.

You can rest only if you have at least two cards in your hand and/or discard pile.

### SHORT REST

You can perform a short rest at the end of a round. When you do, **return all cards from your discard pile to your hand** and flip them to their **A-side**. Then, you **lose one card at random**. If you want to, you can suffer 1 damage to lose a different random card instead.

### LONG REST

Instead of choosing two cards for the round, you can declare a long rest. You’ll take your turn at initiative 99 and follow these steps:

1. **Return all cards from your discard pile to your hand.** Then, lose **one card of your choice** from your hand.
2. Perform “**Heal +2, self.**”
3. You will also recover **items**, but you don’t have any items right now. You can learn about items after you are done playing the first scenario.

## Exhaustion

You can become **exhausted** in two ways:

* **No Hit Points:** If you have zero hit points.
* **No Cards:** If you don’t have two cards in hand (to play) or two cards in your hand and discard pile (to rest).

If you become exhausted, you lose the scenario.

## Continuing to Learn and Play

Using what you have learned so far, you should be able to play the rest of the scenario until you reach the goal or become exhausted.

After finishing the scenario, you should review what you have learned by reading the full rules.

There are a few concepts not covered by this booklet you will want to take special notice of:

* Items
* Recover
* Scenario Effects
* Terrain
* Upgraded Abilities

Good luck, adventurer!
