# Wyrmspan Rulebook

## Table of Contents

You are an amateur dracologist in the world of Wyrmspan, a place where dragons of all shapes, sizes, and colors roam the skies. Excavate a hidden labyrinth you recently unearthed on your land and entice these beautiful creatures to roost in the sanctuary of your caves.

## Components

### PAPER/CARDBOARD

* 1 Dragon Guild board
* 4 (double-sided) Dragon Guild tiles
* 183 dragon cards (“dragons”)
* 75 cave cards
* 1 card display board
* 1 round tracker board
* 10 (double-sided) objective tiles
* 5 player mats
* 10 (double-sided) quick start guides
* 1 score pad

### COINS/TOKENS/EGGS/MARKERS

* 45 coins (silver)
* 25 meat tokens (red)
* 25 gold tokens (yellow)
* 25 crystal tokens (purple)
* 25 milk tokens (white)
* 55 eggs
* 20 multiplier tokens (for resources and eggs)
* 1 round marker
* 1 start player marker

### PLAYER PIECES

* 1 adventurer in each color
* 8 player markers (4 for objective scoring; 4 for the Dragon Guild) in each color
* 1 guild token in each color

**NOTE:** Your player markers are limited, but all other components are not. If you run out of any non-player-marker pieces during the game, use a suitable replacement.

## SETUP

Place the following items in the center of the table:

1. **DRAGON GUILD BOARD** Select 1 of the 4 Dragon Guild tiles at random and place it in the center of the Dragon Guild board with the appropriate side (based on player count) face up.

2. **CARD DISPLAY BOARD**
   * **DRAGONS** Shuffle all dragons together and place 3 dragons face up on the card display board in the designated spaces. Place the dragon deck nearby (face down).
   * **CAVE CARDS** Shuffle all cave cards together and place 3 cave cards face up on the card display board in the designated spaces. Place the cave card deck nearby (face down).

3. **ROUND TRACKER BOARD** Place the round marker on the Round 1 space. Shuffle the objective tiles, then place 4 of them at random on the designated spaces on the round tracker board with a random side facing up. Return the others to the box.

4. Place the coins, eggs, and all tokens in a public supply in reach of all players.

### EACH PLAYER GAINS:

* 1 player mat and all player pieces of 1 color (1 adventurer, 8 player markers, and 1 guild token)
* 6 coins
* 1 egg

  *All eggs are used identically. The colors of the eggs are purely for aesthetics.*
* **3 dragon cards (drawn from the deck) & 3 cave cards (drawn from the deck)**

  Choose a total of 4 cards (in any combination of dragons and cave cards) to keep as their starting hand either face up or face down. Discard the other 2 cards to create face-up discard piles.

* **3 resources of their choice**

  Gain the 3 tokens in any combination of gold, crystal, meat, and milk.

  **TIP:** We recommend that players first look at their starting cards, then choose which resources to gain from the general supply based on those starting cards. Typically (though not always) players will wish to gain resources that match 1 or more of their starting dragon(s).

EACH PLAYER THEN:

1. Places their player mat in front of them (see the image on the right).
2. Places their starting resources in their player area (left of their mat).
3. Places their starting egg on 1 of the 2 nest icons on their player mat.

   **IMPORTANT:** Although there are 2 nest icons, players begin the game with only 1 egg.
4. Places their starting coins to the left of their mat.
5. Places their adventurer in Base Camp (on their player mat).
6. Places their guild token on the Dragon Guild space labeled “START.”
7. Places their remaining player markers, dragons, and cave cards nearby.

Randomly give a player the start player marker, then begin the game.

## OVERVIEW

During a game of Wyrmspan, you will build a sanctuary for dragons. Your sanctuary begins with 3 excavated spaces—the leftmost space in your Crimson Cavern, your Golden Grotto, and your Amethyst Abyss. Throughout the game, you will build out these 3 caves from left to right, first excavating each empty space, then playing dragons into these excavated spaces.

Each turn, you will take 1 of 5 actions: (1) excavate a space; (2) entice a dragon to come live in an excavated space; (3) explore your Crimson Cavern; (4) explore your Golden Grotto; or (5) explore your Amethyst Abyss.

### TERMINOLOGY

**PLAYER MAT** Your personal player mat that holds cave cards, dragons, and eggs.

**CAVE CARD** Square cards that are added to your player mat through the excavate action. Each cave card that you play covers 1 of the 9 empty spaces on your player mat and turns that space into an excavated space.

**DRAGON** Rectangular cards that may be placed onto any excavated space, including the 3 spaces that are excavated at the beginning of the game.

**RESOURCES** Meat tokens, gold tokens, crystal tokens, and milk tokens. Coins and eggs are not considered “resources.”

**CAVE** A row of spaces on your player mat. Each player mat has 3 caves: the Crimson Cavern, the Golden Grotto, and the Amethyst Abyss.

**DISCARD/PAY** Remove the cards, coins, eggs, or resources from your player area, hand, or nests, placing them in the public supply. Cards are always discarded face up.

### GAMEPLAY

Wyrmspan takes place over 4 rounds. Each round, players take several turns in clockwise order, beginning with the player who has the start player marker.

Players continue taking turns until they decide to pass; this typically occurs when a player has used all of their coins or they do not have any dragons in their hand that they wish to (or can afford to) play. Once a player has passed, they may not take any additional turns during that round, but they may still gain benefits during other players’ turns.

Other players who have not passed continue to take turns until they spend all of their coins or otherwise choose to pass. Once all players have passed, the round ends.

Note that when players pass, they may carry over coins, resources, cave cards, dragons, and nested eggs into the next round.

**IMPORTANT:** You may never place items on or remove items from other players’ player mats; all abilities that you activate allow you to interact only with the general supply, the central boards (Dragon Guild board, card display board, etc.), and your own player mat.

The winner of Wyrmspan is the player with the most victory points (VP). These are earned in a variety of ways, including the VP value of played dragons, eggs, tucked cards, public objectives, and the [Dragon Guild](#dragon-guild).

**TIP:** It is strongly recommended that players use most (or all) of their coins prior to passing. Players gain an income of 6 coins at the beginning of each round (and in rare circumstances may gain 1 additional coin after they pass for a round). At the end of each player’s turn, that player must discard down to 9 coins, 9 cards, and 9 resource tokens.

### ON YOUR TURN

Select one action on your player mat (excavate, entice, or explore), move your adventurer there, pay the cost of that action (place the coin/eggs on the action), and then perform the action. *If the public supply of eggs or coins runs low, players may return excess tokens from their mats to the supply; however, players must track the number of times they have explored each cave during the round.*

## EXCAVATE

PLAY A CAVE CARD INTO 1 OF YOUR CAVES.

1. Select the left-most empty space in 1 of the 3 caves to excavate. You must excavate each cave from left to right.

   * The first space in each cave is already excavated, so over the course of the game you may excavate the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th spaces in each cave.
   * Any cave card can be placed in any cave; the colors of the cave cards are purely for aesthetics.

2. Pay the base cost of 1 coin, placing it on the excavate action on your player mat. Then, pay 1 egg if you are excavating the 3rd column or 2 eggs if you are excavating the 4th.

   * Eggs may be paid from any dragon(s) in your cave or from the nest icons on your player mat.

   **NOTE:** Although you may add multiple cave cards to your player mat each round, every time you take the excavate action, you may only excavate 1 space (unless the cave card you play directs otherwise).

3. Play a cave card from your hand onto the empty space you have chosen to excavate.

   * Place the cave card so that it is aligned with the empty square on your player mat. Leave the stop sign visible (below the cave card).

   **NOTE:** If you gain a benefit that allows you to excavate for free, you do not need to pay the coin to excavate or the eggs associated with placing a cave card into that column.

4. **In Either Order:**

   Activate the “when played” benefit on the cave card you just played.

   * These benefits are optional, though are typically to your advantage to take. Note that if you place a cave card that gives opponents something, all other players must be given the option to activate their part of the benefit (even if you decline yours).

     Activate the “when covered” benefit on the player mat space that you just covered, if applicable.

   * The spaces in the 4th column of your player mat allow you to spend 3 items (resources, dragons, and cave cards) in any combination to gain 1 coin. This is optional.

**TIP:** Although gaining an extra coin can be a nice benefit, so is building out the last space in each cave! It is often strategic to excavate this last space before you have enough extra items to make this exchange.

## ENTICE

### ADD A DRAGON TO YOUR PLAYER MAT.

1. Select a dragon from your hand.
2. Pay the base cost of 1 coin, placing it on the entice action on your player mat. Then pay the additional cost printed at the upper-left of the selected dragon (return these to the general supply).
   * This cost is usually a combination of gold, crystal, and meat, but some dragons require an additional coin, an egg, and/or milk.
3. Play the dragon on your player mat, following these rules:
   * You must play the dragon into a cave that matches 1 of the dragon’s preferred habitats (as shown on the left-hand side of the dragon).
   * You must play a dragon into an excavated space on your player mat. Note that you may not play a dragon on top of another (unless an ability explicitly directs you to do so).
   * You must play dragons from left to right within each cave.
4. After you play a dragon, gain the “when played” benefit printed on the dragon (if any).

**NOTE:** Although you may play multiple dragons each round, every time you take the entice action, you may only play 1 dragon (unless the dragon you play directs otherwise).

**IMPORTANT:** A fully completed player mat can contain at most 12 dragons. Abilities that allow you to replace or cover dragons are rare, so choose wisely!

#### IF YOU ALREADY KNOW WINGSPAN

...please pay close attention to these key differences in Wyrmspan:

* Actions are performed by spending coins and often eggs (not action cubes)
* Explore your caves from left to right to activate abilities (not right to left)
* There are two nest icons on your cave mat even before you play a dragon
* Start the game with your choice of 4 cards (from 3 dragons and 3 caves) and a choice of any 3 resources
* Gain 6 coins and 1 egg at the beginning of each round (four total rounds)
* A 2-for-1 resource exchange can be used at any time (not just when playing a card)
* You must excavate a cave space before enticing (playing) a dragon to that space; you begin the game with 3 excavated spaces
* Card abilities are optional. If an ability gives an opponent a benefit, they may gain it even if you decline to do so.
* Discard down to 9 cards, 9 coins, and 9 resource tokens at the end of each of your turns
* The end-round goal scoring is friendly. For example, if two people tie for first, they both gain full VP for first place. The next player takes second place.

### DRAGON ABILITIES

All dragons have an ability or benefit printed on them. These come in 4 types:

When you play a dragon with a “when played” benefit, you may gain the indicated benefit immediately. Unless you have a special ability, you will only activate this ability once. These benefits are not mandatory, though it is usually in your best interest to gain them. If you play a dragon that gives opponents a benefit, the other players must be allowed to collect their benefit, even if you decline yours.

Whenever your adventurer walks onto a dragon card with an “if activated” ability, you may activate that ability. If you activate an “if activated” ability that gives opponents a benefit, the other players must be allowed to collect that benefit, even if you decline to do so.

**IMPORTANT:** “If activated” abilities do not activate the turn that you play the dragon.

“Once per round” abilities provide a benefit at the end of every round. See additional details in the Round End/Upkeep section. If you activate a “once per round” ability that gives opponents a benefit, the other players must be allowed to collect that benefit, even if you decline to do so.

“End game” abilities provide Victory Points (VP) at the end of the game for meeting certain conditions.

**IMPORTANT:** Whenever a dragon looks for a specific category (e.g., in this cave, a trait, a size, etc.), the dragon includes itself if applicable. For example, the Smirking Ridgeback (card 130) looks for playful dragons to tuck a card under; because the Smirking Ridgeback is a playful dragon, a card is tucked under it too.

Certain dragons and cave cards direct you to cache a resource onto a dragon, tuck a card under a dragon, lay an egg, or pay an egg:

**CACHING A RESOURCE** means that you place that resource onto a dragon. Unless otherwise specified, resources that you cache must come from your personal supply. Cached resources remain in place until the end of the game and are worth 1 VP each, unless otherwise specified.

Resources must be cached onto the dragon that gives you the ability to do so, unless otherwise specified. A dragon that allows you to cache a resource “here” provides you with the ability to cache a resource onto that dragon.

**TUCKING A CARD** means you place a face-down dragon card underneath an already played dragon on your player mat. Unless otherwise specified, cards that you tuck must come from your hand. Tucked cards remain in place until the end of the game and are worth 1 VP each, unless otherwise specified.

Cards must be tucked under the dragon that gives you the ability to do so, unless otherwise specified by dragon abilities. A dragon that allows you to tuck a card “here” provides you with the ability to tuck a card underneath that dragon.

**IMPORTANT:** Tucked cards do not count as dragons for purposes of end game abilities or end-of-round goals that require you to have a specific number or type of dragons on your player mat. For instance, if you have a dragon that gives you VP for every medium dragon you have on your player mat, tucked medium dragons do not count.

**LAY AN EGG OR PAY AN EGG:**

An ability that lets you “lay an egg” allows you to place an egg onto any dragon with an empty nest icon or onto 1 of the 2 nest icons printed on your player mat. Each nest icon, regardless of its location, can hold 1 egg. If you do not have an empty nest icon available, then you may not lay an egg.

Note that some dragons direct you to lay an egg “here.” This allows you to lay an egg only on that dragon. Other dragons direct you to lay an egg anywhere in a certain cave or a certain column.

Any time you are directed to “pay an egg,” you may discard an egg from any dragon on your player mat or from a nest on your player mat.

Note that some dragons require you to pay an egg from a specific location (e.g. “Pay an egg from anywhere in this cave”).

Eggs on your dragons and player mat at the end of the game are worth 1 VP each, unless otherwise specified.

### HATCHLINGS

Hatchlings are a special type of dragon. All hatchlings require you to pay an egg, and all require you to pay 1, 2, or 3 milk. All Hatchlings have a 3-part ability:

1. All hatchlings have an “if activated” ability. Each time your adventurer walks onto a hatchling, you may cache 1 resource (milk or meat) onto the hatchling or tuck 1 card under the hatchling, as specified on the card.
2. Any time you cache the specified resource on that hatchling or tuck a card under that hatchling, you gain a benefit. Note that you gain this benefit regardless of whether the cache or tuck ability came from walking your adventurer onto that card or from another ability.
3. The 3rd time you cache the specified resource on that hatchling or tuck a card under that hatchling, you gain their regular benefit and a bonus that is triggered once per game. This represents the hatchling growing up.

**IMPORTANT:** You may still continue to activate the hatchling’s first 2 abilities (in the example above, caching a meat to gain a gold) even after the bonus is triggered.

**IMPORTANT:** Note that hatchlings function differently from other “if activated” dragons, as indicated by the card layout. Adult dragons with an “if activated” ability only allow you to activate that ability when your adventurer walks onto that dragon. In contrast, the second ability on each hatchling does not have an “if activated” ability on it, meaning that it activates any time that condition is met, regardless of whether it was triggered by your adventurer.

**NOTE:** As all good dracologists know, most hatchlings are born deep underground and require purple crystals to thrive. As such, keep in mind that most hatchlings live in the Amethyst Abyss. If you’re looking for hatchlings that live in the Golden Grotto or Crimson Cavern, you may have a hard time finding one!

## EXPLORE

**EXPLORE YOUR CRIMSON CAVERN:** Walk your adventurer through your Crimson Cavern and activate any “if activated” abilities that your adventurer passes, following these steps in order:

1. Each time you walk through your Crimson Cavern, you must pay the costs printed on your player mat. The 1st time you enter your Crimson Cavern each round, the cost is 1 coin. If you enter a 2nd time that round, the cost is 1 coin and 1 egg. If you enter a 3rd time that round (this is the max, and it’s rare), the cost is 1 coin and 2 eggs.
   * If you walk through your Crimson Cavern a 2nd or 3rd time within a round, pay egg(s) from any dragon(s) or nests on your player mat.
   * Whenever you enter a cave, leave the paid coin and egg(s) on your player mat (covering the associated cost to track how many times they have explored the cave this round). If the public supply of eggs or coins runs low, players may return excess items to the supply.
2. Move your adventurer from left to right within your Crimson Cavern, along the path depicted along the bottom of the cave, and activate all “if activated” abilities that your adventurer passes, in order from left to right.
   * Each time you walk past an “if activated” icon on your player mat, you may activate that ability.
   * Each time you move your adventurer onto a dragon that has an “if activated” icon, you may activate that ability.
3. Whenever your adventurer walks onto Stop Sign (a space without a dragon), your turn ends. Return your adventurer back to Base Camp.

**EXPLORE YOUR GOLDEN GROTTO:** Identical to “Explore your Crimson Cavern,” but for your Golden Grotto. Walk your adventurer through your Golden Grotto and activate any “if activated” abilities that you pass.

**EXPLORE YOUR AMETHYST ABYSS:** Identical to “Explore your Crimson Cavern,” but for your Amethyst Abyss. Walk your adventurer through your Amethyst Abyss and activate any “if activated” abilities that you pass.

## ADDITIONAL RULES, NOTES, AND CONCEPTS

**ABILITY ACTIVATION SEQUENCING:** Any time an ability allows all players to do something, the active player goes first, then all other players have the opportunity to follow in clockwise order. Note that dragons and cave cards are not refilled into the card display board until the end of the current turn, after all players have had the opportunity to activate the ability. This means that in some circumstances, if an “all players gain a card” ability is triggered, not all players will have the opportunity to gain a faceup card (though they may still draw from the deck).

**ACQUIRING ITEMS:** Whenever you acquire a dragon, a cave card, or a resource, by default that item goes into your hand or your personal supply. Some dragons allow you to acquire an item and also provide optional secondary abilities, such as caching a resource or tucking a card. If you decline to do so, that item remains in your hand or your supply.

*For example, see the Beckoning Cricketcatcher to the right. At the end of each round, you gain 1 card (from the face-up display or from the deck). After looking at it, decide whether to keep it in your hand or to tuck it under any dragon. If you tuck this card under a hatchling with a “tuck” ability, gain the benefit provided by that hatchling.*

**ACTIVATING ABILITIES MULTIPLE TIMES:** Some abilities allow you to perform an action or exchange up to a certain number of times. Resolve each exchange or action individually. (You may use your benefit from the first exchange to pay for the second exchange, if applicable.)

**CAPACITY LIMITS:** At the end of each of your turns, you may have a maximum of 9 resource tokens, 9 dragons and/or cave cards (combined), and 9 coins. Discard any excess items until you have 9 of each type. If you gain an item that causes you to go over your capacity limit during another player’s turn, you do not need to discard down until the end of your next turn.

**CARD REFILL:** Do not refill dragons or cave cards into the card display board until the end of each player’s turn.

**GAINING CARDS:** There are 3 different phrases associated with gaining cards, all of which have different meanings.

* **GAIN A DRAGON OR A CAVE CARD:** Unless additional restrictions are specified, you may gain a card from either the face-up display or from the top of the deck. Note that there may be times when you have a “gain” ability, but there are no face-up cards in the display. If this happens, you may still draw from the top of the deck.
* **GAIN A DRAGON OR A CAVE CARD FROM THE DISPLAY:** If the “from the display” instruction is included, you must select a face-up card. If there is no card in the display, then you may not take this benefit.
* **DRAW A DRAGON OR A CAVE CARD:** To “draw” means you may only take a card from the top of the relevant deck.
* **REVEAL A DRAGON CARD:** Show the top card of the deck to all players. The ability will specify if you do something with the card; if not, return it to the top of the deck.

**ON YOUR PLAYER MAT OR IN A CAVE:** Abilities that refer to the number of dragons on your player mat or in a cave never count tucked cards. Hatchlings are dragons.

**PAYING AN ITEM:** Certain abilities direct you to pay an item to trigger an ability. This requires you to discard that item from your hand (cave card or dragon), from your supply (resources or coins), or from any nest icon (egg) on your player mat, unless explicitly specified otherwise.

**RESOURCES:** Resources are gold, crystal, meat, and milk. Resources do not include coins or eggs.

* **RESOURCE EXCHANGE:** At any point during the game, you may exchange 2 resources (gold, crystal, meat, and milk) in any combination for 1 resource of another type.

## DRAGON GUILD

Throughout the game, players earn Dragon Guild advancements by walking their adventurers through their caves or playing certain dragons or cave cards. Every time a player takes a Dragon Guild advancement, they move their guild token 1 space clockwise around the Dragon Guild track, then immediately gain the benefit printed on the space their token lands on. Each space may hold any number of guild tokens. If a player activates more than 1 advancement in a turn, they receive all benefits that they pass, in addition to those printed on the space that they land on.

Every time a player reaches 1 of the 2 brown spaces on the Dragon Guild track (the bottom space or the top space), they must immediately place an unused player marker onto a square on the Dragon Guild tile and collect the corresponding benefits. Each square can hold 1 player marker. Note, however, that the bottom right space of each Dragon Guild tile—a long rectangle—can hold any number of player markers.

Note that each player may place a maximum of 4 player markers onto the Dragon Guild tile. Once a player has placed their 4th player marker onto the Dragon Guild tile, they may continue to advance around the Dragon Guild track, but they cannot place any further player markers there.

**IMPORTANT:** If more than 1 player reaches a brown space on the same turn, they select their bonuses in clockwise order, beginning with the active player.

**NOTE:** If space is available, the same player may collect the same bonus more than once.

## SELECT DRAGON GUILD POWERS EXPLAINED

| DRAGON GUILD TILE | ABILITY | RULES |
|-|-|-|
| **Guild of Highlands** | Pay a coin, then excavate up to 2 spaces for free with cave cards from your hand. | Discard 1 coin, then you may excavate up to 2 spaces (in the same cave or different caves) without paying coin or egg costs. If you only have 1 cave card in your hand or you only wish to excavate 1 space, you may choose to forfeit the 2nd excavation. |
| **Guild of Highlands** | Pay a cave card, then play a dragon from your hand on top of any other dragon on your player mat for free. | Discard a cave card from your hand, then play a dragon from your hand onto another dragon already in your cave, without paying any costs. You still need to play the dragon into one of its preferred caves. The original dragon on the space becomes tucked, and any tucked cards, cached resources, or eggs associated with the original dragon transfer to the new dragon. The new dragon can only store a number of eggs up to its printed capacity, and any surplus eggs are discarded. |
| **Rainforest Guild** | Gain 1 VP for every printed resource cost on all dragons in any one of your caves. | Choose 1 cave (Crimson Cavern, Golden Grotto, or Amethyst Abyss). Count the resource icons (gold, meat, crystal, and milk) printed in the cost section of all dragons in that cave (do not count tucked cards). Gain 1 VP for each icon. |

## TURN END

Your turn ends after you have completed 1 action (excavate, entice, or explore). Then:

* You must discard down to 9 coins, 9 cards, and 9 resource tokens.
* Play proceeds clockwise to the next player who has not yet passed this round.

## ROUND END/UPKEEP

After all players pass, the round ends. At the end of the round:

1. Players discard any coins and eggs that they paid as costs on their player mat.

2. All “once per round” dragon abilities activate.
   1. Players activate “once per round” abilities in turn order, starting with that round’s start player. If a player has multiple “once per round” dragons on their player mat, they may activate these dragons in any order.
   2. If a “once per round” dragon has an ability that presents all players with a choice or benefit, in clockwise order (starting with the owner of the dragon) each player makes their choice or gains their benefit.

3. The round’s objective is scored.

   Each player places 1 player marker on the round tracker underneath that round’s objective, corresponding to their position relative to other players. Players gain VP for these objectives at the end of the game.

   1. If two or more players tie for 1st place, those players place their markers on the “1st place” space. The next player then places their marker on the “2nd place” space.
   2. If a player has no items specified by the objective (has a “zero” for that objective), then they place their player marker on “all others” (0 VP), regardless of their position relative to other players.

   **NOTE:** Each tile has the Automa solo mode icon and some numbers; ignore those numbers in games with 2+ players.

At the beginning of the next round:

1. The round marker moves 1 space to the right.
2. Refresh the cards in the display. The 3 face-up dragons and the 3 face-up cave cards in the display are discarded, and 3 new cards of each type are placed face up in the display.
3. Each player gains 6 coins and 1 egg.

   Players add these coins to any coin(s) they carried over from the previous round. Players may add the egg to any nest icon on their dragons or player mat if possible; if not, they may not gain the egg.
4. The start player marker advances 1 player clockwise.

## GAME END AND SCORING

At the end of the game, add up your victory points from the following categories:

* **MARKERS ON THE DRAGON GUILD**
* **PRINTED VP VALUES** on visible dragons on your player mat (not in hand and not tucked)
* **END GAME ABILITIES** on visible dragons on your player mat (not in hand and not tucked)
* **EGGS:** Gain 1 VP per egg, unless otherwise specified.
* **CACHED RESOURCES:** Gain 1 VP per cached resource, unless otherwise specified.
* **TUCKED CARDS:** Gain 1 VP per tucked dragon, unless otherwise specified.
* **PUBLIC OBJECTIVES:** Ties are friendly. All players whose markers are at a certain level gain the VP printed on that space. For instance, if several players are tied for 1st place for scoring objective 3, those players would gain 6 VP. The next highest player for that objective would score 3 VP(for being in 2nd place).
* **EXCESS ITEMS AND COINS:**
  * Gain 1 VP per coin you have remaining.
  * Gain 1 VP for every 4 other items (in any combination: resources, dragon cards, and cave cards) that you have remaining. Round down.

The player with the most VP wins! If tied, the player with the most visible dragons on their player mat (not including tucked cards) wins. If still tied, the victory is shared.
