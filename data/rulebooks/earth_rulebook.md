# Earth Rulebook

Earth, the soil that supports and sustains our beautiful planet, Earth. Over millions of years of evolution and adaptation, the Flora and Fauna of this unique planet have grown and developed into amazing life-forms, creating symbiotic ecosystems and habitats. It's time to jump into these rich environments and create some amazing natural synergies that replicate and extrapolate on Earth's amazing versatility and plethora of natural resources.

Create a self-supporting engine of growth, expansion and supply where even your unused Flora become compost for future growth. Earth is an open-world engine builder for 1 to 5 players with simple rules but many strategic possibilities.

With the enormous number of unique cards and combinations, every game will allow you to discover new synergies and connections, just as Our vast and fascinating world allows us to do!

## OBJECTIVE

The objective in Earth is to score as many Victory Points (VP) as possible. To do so, you will “plant” cards to create your own island—a 16-card tableau arranged as a grid 4 cards wide by 4 cards tall.

The game ends **at the end of a round** after a player plants their 16th card, which completes their island.

Players will score points for the value of Flora and Event cards, for Growth and Sprouts placed on their Flora, for cards in their Compost, and for Ecosystem, Fauna, and Terrain bonus points.

*Balancing these elements and creating an effective engine is key to maximizing your Victory Points!*

The first player to fill their 4x4 tableau with 16 cards triggers the game end and earns a bonus of 7 VP.

| | Island cards dealt to each player | Climate cards dealt to each player | Ecosystem cards dealt to each player | Fauna board |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Beginner | 1 | 1 | Not used | No Ecosystem Cards |
| Standard | 1 | 1 | 1        | 2 Ecosystem Cards  |
| Advanced | 2 | 2 | 2        | 2 Ecosystem Cards  |

## SHARED SETUP

**Place the Fauna board** in the center of the table within view of all players. For a simpler game, use the beginner side of the board, marked with a TODO icon in the center.

**Hand out a player board** to each player. Make sure all players are using the same side (front) of their player board. *The back of some boards are used for other game variations, including solo and teams.*

> Leave space next to each player board where a 4x4 tableau of cards can be created during game play. A tableau and player board create the player's area.

**Create the central supply** by placing all Sprouts, Soil tokens, and Growth (Trunk, Canopy) next to the Fauna board.

**Shuffle all Earth cards** and place them in a facedown draw pile (or piles) within reach of all players. Leave space for a discard pile next to the draw pile(s).

**Shuffle the Fauna cards** and then place one on each of the 4 TODO spaces on the Fauna board, with either side faceup. *The remaining Fauna cards will not be used for this game and should be returned to the box.*

**Shuffle the Ecosystem cards** and then place one on each of the 2 TODO spaces on the Fauna board, with either side faceup. Then deal 1 Ecosystem card to each player and continue to the **INDIVIDUAL SETUP**. The remaining Ecosystem cards will not be used for this game and should be returned to the box.

> In a beginner game, Ecosystem cards are not used and can remain in the box.

## INDIVIDUAL SETUP

**Shuffle the Island cards**, and then deal one to each player. *The remainder will not be used for this game and should be returned to the box.*

**Repeat with the Climate cards.**

> For advanced players, deal out 2Island, 2 Climate, and 2 Ecosystem cards for them to choose from.

**Once all players are ready,** randomly choose a starting player, and give them the First player token and the Active player token.

Each player must now **select one side of their Island, Climate, and Ecosystem cards** to use by placing it faceup on its corresponding space on their player board.

> Island, Climate, and Ecosystem cards grant different starting resources, abilities, and Victory Points - it is recommended to check the Fauna board and choose cards that will help you achieve these objectives.

**Each player takes 5 Leaf tokens** of one colour, placing 4 of them on the central leaf spaces on their player board and keeping the Sth to the side—it can be used to track their action selection each turn.

## GETTING STARTED

Each player draws a number of Earth cards as indicated on
their **ISLAND** card.

After reviewing these cards, players simultaneously choose which ones they want to keep in their hand, and which they will Compost. They **must** Compost from their hand the number of cards as indicated on their **ISLAND** card.

To Compost a card, the player simply removes it from their hand and places it facedown on the Compost icon on their player board—this creates their personal Compost.

Each player takes the number of Soil indicated on their **ISLAND** card and places them on the central area of their player board—this creates their personal reserve.

> There are 20 Islands, 20 Climates, and 64 Ecosystems, which means that there are 25,600 possible starting setups-welcome to nature's diversity!
