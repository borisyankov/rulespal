* RULES BOOKLET

## GAME SET UP

* Shuffle all the sushi cards well. Place them in a face-down draw pile in the centre of the table.
* Each player places 1 train and 1 tray card in front of them.

## GAMEPLAY

### STARTING A ROUND

The game takes place over 3 rounds.

At the start of each round, one player deals cards from the draw pile, face-down to each player.

* In a 2 player game, deal 10 cards to each player.
* In a 3 player game, deal 9 cards to each player.
* In a 4 player game, deal 8 cards to each player.
* In a 5 player game, deal 7 cards to each player.

The players take the cards into their hands.

During the game, the cards in players’ hands are kept secret.

### PLAYING A ROUND

The players take their turns **simultaneously**. Each turn, all players choose any 1 card from their hand that they would like to keep. They place this card face-down on the table in front of them. When each player has done this, everyone turns their chosen card face-up.

After revealing cards, the players pass their remaining hand face-down to the player on their **left**. Everyone picks up their new hand, and the next turn begins. The players now have a new and smaller hand to choose from.

Kept cards remain with the player until the end of the round, when they are scored. It is helpful to group cards of the same type together on the table.

### USING WASABI

If a player chooses a squid, salmon or egg nigiri card, and already has a wasabi card in front of them, then this nigiri **must** be placed on top of the wasabi. This is to show that the nigiri has been dipped in wasabi and has **tripled in value**!

Only 1 nigiri card may be placed on each wasabi card. A player may have multiple wasabi cards in front of them.

### USING CHOPSTICKS

If a player already has a chopsticks card in front of them, they **may** take 2 sushi cards on a turn!

Here’s how it works: The player chooses the first card they would like from their hand as usual. Before everyone else reveals their cards, the player calls out **“Sushi Go!”** and takes a second card from their hand, also placing it face-down on the table. Then all players reveal the cards they have chosen.

Before hands are passed on, the player who used their chopsticks card puts it into their hand. This means the chopsticks will now be passed on, and other players may take them to use again.

A player may have multiple chopsticks cards in front of them, but may only use 1 per turn.

### ENDING A ROUND

When the final remaining card of each hand is passed on, the player receiving it simply places it face-up with the other cards they have collected. Often this final card won’t be much use, but sometimes an unfortunate player will be forced to leave you with something valuable!

The players now score the cards they have collected, as follows.

## SCORING

### SUSHI ROLLS

Each player adds up the sushi roll icons at the top of all their sushi roll cards. The player with the most icons scores **6 points**. If multiple players tie for the most, they split the points evenly (ignoring any remainder) and no second place points are awarded.

The player with the second most icons scores **3 points**. If multiple players tie for second place, they split the points evenly (ignoring any remainder).

**NOTE:** A player must have at least 1 sushi roll card to be counted in the sushi roll scoring!

### TEMPURA

A set of 2 tempura cards scores **5 points**. A single tempura card is worth nothing. A player may score multiple sets of tempura in a round.

### SASHIMI

A set of 3 sashimi cards scores 10 points. A single sashimi card or a set of only 2 is worth nothing. A player may score multiple sets of sashimi in a round, although this is very hard to do!

### DUMPLINGS

The more dumpling cards a player has, the more points they will score, as follows:

| Dumplings: | 1 | 2 | 3 |  4 | 5 or more |
|------------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:----------|
| Points:    | 1 | 3 | 6 | 10 | 15 |

### NIGIRI AND WASABI

A squid nigiri scores **3 points**.  
If it is on top of a wasabi card it scores **9 points**.

A salmon nigiri scores **2 points**.  
If it is on top of a wasabi card it scores **6 points**.

An egg nigiri scores **1 point**.  
If it is on top of a wasabi card it scores **3 points**.

A wasabi card with no nigiri on it scores **nothing**.

### CHOPSTICKS

A chopsticks card scores **nothing**.

### BEFORE STARTING A NEW ROUND

The players announce their scores for the round. They indicate their current total score by adjusting their tray card on top of their train card.

All cards from the round are now discarded face-up beside the draw pile. The only exception are **pudding cards** which are kept in front of the players to be scored at the end of the game.

## ENDING THE GAME

After the third round is scored, there will be some cards remaining in the draw deck. These are ignored.

Now it’s time for dessert! Pudding cards are now scored.

### PUDDINGS

The player with the most pudding cards scores **6 points**. If multiple players tie for the most, they split the points evenly (ignoring any remainder).

The player with the least pudding cards (including players with none) ***loses* 6 points**. If multiple players tie for the least, they split the lost points evenly (ignoring any remainder).

On the rare occasion that all players have the same number of pudding cards, no one scores anything for them.

**NOTE:** In a 2 player game, no one loses any points for puddings. Only the points for most pudding cards are awarded.

### AND THE WINNER IS...

Whoever has the most points after 3 rounds is the winner!  
In case of a tie, whoever has the most pudding cards wins!

## VARIANT RULE

### PASS BOTH WAYS

To change how the players interact, simply alternate which way you pass the cards each round. In rounds 1 and 3, pass each hand the left. In round 2, pass each hand to the right.
