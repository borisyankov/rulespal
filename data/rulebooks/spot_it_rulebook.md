# Spot it! Rulebook

## Table of Contents

## Dobble, what is it?

Dobble consists of 55 cards, with 8 symbols per card from the 50 available. There is **only one identical symbol** in common between each card, it is up to you to find out which one.

## Before playing...

If you’ve never played or if you’re playing with people who’ve never played before, draw two random cards and place them face-up on the table between all the players. **Look for the identical symbol between the two cards** (same shape, same color, only the size can be different). The first player to find the right symbol names it out loud and draws two new cards which are then placed face-up on the table. Repeat this until each player understands **that there’s always only one identical symbol** between two cards.

That’s it, now you know how to play **Dobble!**

## Object of the game

No matter the game, you always need to be the fastest **to spot the identical symbol** between two cards, **name it out loud** and then **take the card**, **place it** or **discard it** depending on the rules of the mini-game you’re currently playing.

## The mini-games

**Dobble** is a series of quickness-based mini-games in which **all the players play at the same time**. You can play the mini-games in a specific order, randomly, or you can keep playing the same one over and over. The only important thing is to have fun! Read the rules of the selected mini-game (or the randomly chosen one) to all the players before starting. Don’t hesitate to have a practice round to make sure every player understands the rules.

## End of the game

The player who has won the most mini-games wins the game.

For tournament lovers, a point system is offered at the end of the rules.

## In case of doubt?

It’s the first player to have named the symbol who wins! If players have spoken at the same time, it’s whoever has taken, placed or discarded his or her card first who wins.

## Ties

At the end of a mini-game, the tied players duel (or have a round of “hot potato” if there are more than two). They each draw a card and reveal it at the same time. The first one to find the identical symbol and name it out loud wins the duel.

## Point system for tournaments

Start with the “the towering inferno”, the loser chooses the next mini-game.

**The towering inferno**: +1 point per card gained / +5 points to the player who has gained the most cards

**The well**: +10 points for the first player to get rid of all his or her cards / -20 for the last one

**The poisoned gift**: +20 points for the player who has gained the fewest cards / +10 points for the second

**The hot potato**: -5 points per lost round

**Gotta catch them all**: +1 point per card gained

## The towering inferno

1) **Set-up:** shuffle the cards, place one **face down** in front of each player and make a draw pile with the remaining cards, which will be placed **face-up** in the middle of the table.
2) **Object of the game:** to be the player who has gained the most cards from the draw pile when the game ends.
3) **How to play?** On go, the players flip their card face-up. Each player must be **the fastest at spotting the identical symbol between his or her card and the first card of the draw pile**. The first player to find the symbol names it, takes the card from the draw pile and places it in front of him or her, on top of his or her card. By taking this card, a new card is revealed. The game continues until all the cards from the draw pile have been drawn.
4) **The winner:** The game stops once all the cards in the draw pile have been gained. The winner is **the player who has gained the most cards**.

## The well

1) **Set-up:** deal all the cards, one at a time, to all players, starting with the player who won the last mini-game. Place the last card in the middle of the table, **face-up**. Each player shuffles his or her cards and makes a draw pile placed before him or her, **face down**.
2) **Object of the game:** to be the fastest to get rid of all your cards – make sure you’re not the last!
3) **How to play?** On go, the players flip their draw pile face-up. Players must be faster than the others to **discard the cards from their draw pile by placing them on the card in the middle**. To do that, they have to name the identical symbol between the top card of their draw pile and the card in the middle. As the middle card changes as soon as a player places one of his or her cards on top of it, players must be quick.
4) **The winner:** The **last player to get rid of his or her cards** loses the game.

## The hot potato

(played over multiple rounds)

1) **Set-up:** on each round, give each player a card he or she will keep hidden in their hand without looking at it. Set the remaining cards aside, they will be used for the subsequent rounds.
2) **Object of the game:** to be faster than the other players to get rid of your card.
3) **How to play?** On go the players reveal their cards while making sure that all the symbols are clearly visible (the best way is to hold the card in your open hand, like in the image). **As soon as a player finds the identical symbol between his card and an opponent’s card, the player names it and places his or her card on the opponent’s card**. That opponent must now find the identical symbol between this new card and those of the remaining players. If that player manages to do so, all of his or her cards are given at once.
4) **The loser:** The last player, who ends up with all the cards, loses the round and places them on the table near himself or herself. The players start as many new rounds as they want (minimum of 5). When there are no more cards to hand out, the mini-game stops and **the losing player is whoever has gained the most cards**.

## Gotta catch them all!

(played over multiple rounds)

1) **Set-up:** on each round, place a face-up card in the middle of the table and place around that card as many face-down cards as there are players. Set the remaining cards aside, they’ll be used for the subsequent rounds.
2) **Object of the game:** get more cards faster than the other players.
3) **How to play?** On go, each player flips (at the same time) one of the cards around the middle card. The players must find **the identical symbol between the middle card and the cards which have just been revealed**. As soon as a player finds an identical symbol, he or she names it, gains the card in question and sets it aside (be careful: you must never take the middle card).
4) **The winner:** as soon as all the revealed cards have been taken, the players place the middle card at the bottom of the draw pile and start a new round. The players keep the cards gained. When there are no longer any cards to be drawn, the mini-game stops and **the winner is whoever gained the most cards**.

## The poisoned gift

1) **Set-up:** shuffle the cards, place one face-down in front of each player and make a draw pile with the remaining cards, which will be placed face-up in the middle of the table.
2) **Object of the game:** to be the player who has gained the fewest cards from the draw pile when the game ends.
3) **How to play?** On go, the players flip their card face-up. Each player must **spot the identical symbol between the card of any other player and the card from the draw pile**. The first player to find an identical symbol names it, draws the middle card and places it on top of the concerned player’s card. By taking this card, a new card is revealed. The mini-game continues until all the cards from the draw pile have been gained.
4) **The winner:** the mini-game ends as soon as all the cards from the draw pile have been gained. **The winner is the player with the fewest cards.**
