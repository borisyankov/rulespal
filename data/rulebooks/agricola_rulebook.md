# Agricola Rulebook

## Game Idea

Central Europe, around 1670 A.D. The Plague which has raged for centuries has finally been overcome. The civilized world is revitalized. People are upgrading and extending their simple wooden houses. Fields must be plowed, sowed, and harvested. People are living off millet gruel, bread, and vegetables. The famine of the previous years has also encouraged them to eat more meat *(a habit that we continue to this day as our wealth is growing)*.

In the end, the wealthiest player wins. Interestingly enough, animals that you do not eat contribute to your wealth.

## Setup

We will explain the rules for 2-4 players first, followed by the solo game rules on the last page.

### Your Personal Display

Choose a player color and take the five people, four stables, and 15 fences in that color.

Take a farmyard board. Place one person in each of your two wood rooms. Your remaining three people as well as your fences and stables constitute your supply. *(Put the components of unused colors as well as the remaining farmyard boards back into the game box—you will not need them.)*

### Room and Field Tiles

Place the stack of clay/stone room tiles next to the game board. Divide the stack of wood room tiles in two, placing one half with the wood rooms facing up and the other with the field tiles facing up.

### Game Board with Action Spaces

Place the game board in the middle of the play area. Depending on the number of players, take the appropriate game board extension and attach it to the game board with the proper side facing up.

Randomly determine who gets the **starting player token**. This player gets 2 food; each other player gets 3 food.

### Improvements and Occupations

#### Major Improvements

Place the red *(“major”)* improvements on the designated spaces of the supply board. Please note that there are two Fireplaces and two Cooking Hearths.

#### Minor Improvements

Shuffle the orange improvements and deal each player a hand of seven cards.

#### Occupations

A square symbol on the left side of the yellow occupation cards indicates the number of players with which the card is used. [1+] stands for 1-4 players, [3+] stands for 3-4 players, and [4] stands for 4 players. Put the cards that you are not supposed to be using according to your number of players back into the game box. Shuffle the remaining cards and deal each player a hand of seven cards.

#### Action Space Cards

Shuffle the 14 action space cards and sort them by the numbers on their back sides. This should result in 6 stacks, which you must place on top of each other in descending order from bottom to top. Thus, the cards for stage 1 should be on top of those for stage 2 etc.

Place all the animals *(sheep, wild boar, cattle)*, building resources *(wood, clay, reed, stone)*, crops *(grain, vegetables)*, and food markers ready at hand as the general supply.

The goods tiles with begging markers on their backs will only be needed occasionally. Place them somewhere on the side of the table—in case you need them.

* **“Side Job” and Other Variant Tiles**
Please check pages 1 and 8 of the appendix on how to use the “Side Job” and the other two variant tiles. You will not need them in the base game.
* **Suggestion Tiles**  
The three yellow suggestion tiles are used in games with inexperienced players and small children (see page 1 of the appendix). Usually, you will not need them at all.

## General Overview

A game of **Agricola** is played over 14 rounds. In each round, you place each of your people on **exactly one action space**, taking the actions provided by it. The available actions are depicted on the game board.

In clockwise order, you take turns to place exactly one person on an action space, until all players have placed all of their people. You will necessarily get in each other’s way, because each action space can only be used by one person in each round. Do not take your people back until all have been placed.

Your goal is to gather food for your family and to develop your farmyard board so that it is worth a lot of points.

## Course of Play

Each of the **14 rounds goes through four phases**, which are played one after another. The work phase is when you place your people on action spaces to take actions. Each round starts with some preparations.

### 1. Preparation Phase

Most action spaces are pre-printed on the game board.
Each round, a new action space enters the game: draw
a card from the top of the pile of action space cards and
place it on the round space whose number is equal to the
current round. (An overview on the back of the “Side
Job” tile tells you which action space cards you can
expect in each stage of the game.)
If there are goods on the round space that were placed
there via certain card effects (see pages 10-11), you will now get those goods.
Next, place the depicted amount of goods on each action space showing an ochercolored arrow, even if there are goods left from previous rounds. These spaces are called
“accumulation spaces”.

### 2. Work Phase

Beginning with the starting player (and in clockwise order),
place exactly one person on an action space, until all players have placed all of their people that are in play*. If an
action space is occupied, you cannot use it for the rest of the round. (Each action space can only be used by one person
per round.) Immediately take the action on that action space. Some action spaces provide multiple actions. You cannot
use an action space without taking at least one of the available actions.

As the game progresses, some players may have more people than others. Skip players who run out of
people to place and proceed with those players in clockwise order who still have people left.
