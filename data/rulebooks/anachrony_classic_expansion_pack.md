## THE DOOMSDAY MODULE

Playing the Doomsday module, players can truly take humanity’s fate into their hands. By conducting various Experiments, they can actively influence the event chain leading up to the Impact, potentially mitigating its effects completely. However, not all Paths share the vision of saving Earth from the second cataclysm — some rather see it as a way to overcome their rival Paths, once and for all...

### EXPERIMENTS AND THE DOOMSDAY TRACK

Experiment cards are a major addition to the main game, and symbolize the Paths’ efforts to influence the time and effect of the incoming Impact. Each Experiment card consists of a condition, a cost and a Victory Point reward. While in Focus, they can be claimed by using the new Experiment Action on the Main board. Each Experiment grants Victory Points to the player who claimed it, as well as a chance to advance on the Doomsday track according to the Path’s interests — either towards saving Earth by mitigating the Impact’s damage, or sealing the planet’s fate. Depending on the movements on the Doomsday track, the Paths can score additional VPs for their Experiments, and even the time of Impact can change.

### CHANGES IN SETUP

1. Place the **Impact tile** between the fifth and sixth Timeline Tile (instead of the fourth and fifth).
2. Once the Timeline has been laid out, place a random face-up **Level 1 Experiment card** below the first Timeline tile, and a face-down Level 1 Experiment card below each other Timeline tile. Return the leftover Level 1 Experiment cards to the box without looking at them. At the start of the game, the first Timeline tile should have a face-up Superproject above and a face-up Level 1 Experiment below it, while all other Superprojects and Experiments should be face down.
3. Place the **Doomsday board** next to the Main board. Treat this as part of the Main board. Place the Trajectory dice on the designated slots on this board, and the Save Earth and Seal Fate tracker tokens on their respective starting positions on the Doomsday Track.
4. Shuffle all **Level 2 Experiment cards** into a face-down stack and place it next to the Doomsday board.
5. Before choosing the 5 random Endgame Condition cards, add the “Most Completed Experiments” card to the card pool.

### 1. PREPARATION PHASE — CHANGES

After flipping the Superproject above the following Era’s Timeline tile, also flip the face-down Level 1 Experiment card below it. Then, place a face-up Level 2 Experiment card from the top of the stack below each Timeline tile with no Experiment card below it.

### NEW ACTION — EXPERIMENT

The Doomsday module introduces a new Main board Action: the Experiment.

When you take the Experiment Action, you may claim an Experiment card if:

* it is **in Focus** for you;
* you **meet the Experiment card’s condition;**
* you **pay the Experiment card’s cost.**

When you successfully claim an Experiment card:

1. **Remove it** from below the Timeline tile and place it next to your Player board as a reminder.
2. If you play the Path of Harmony or the Path of Dominance, you **may move the “Save Earth” tracker one step up** on the Doomsday track.
3. If you play the Path of Salvation or the Path of Progress, you **may move the “Seal Fate” tracker one step down** on the Doomsday track.
4. **Receive a number of VP tokens** indicated on the Experiment card (2 or 3), and potentially additional VPs depending on the marker’s new position on the Doomsday track (see below).

#### Worker specifics

* The Experiment Action can be taken by any Worker.

Experiment has a Hex Pool space, where any number of Workers can be placed.

### THE DOOMSDAY TRACK

Whenever a player conducts an Experiment, they may move either the “Save Earth” tracker one step up, or the “Seal Fate” tracker one step down, depending on their Path. After this movement, **if there is a Victory Point value printed next to the spot associated with the player’s Path** (see the Path symbols in the four corners), that player receives that amount of Victory Points in addition to the claimed Experiment’s Victory Point value. **Only the player that moved the tracker may gain Victory Points from the Doomsday track**. The Paths of Harmony and Salvation receive larger amounts of Victory Point for the last two steps in each direction, while the Paths of Dominance and Progress receive smaller amounts of Victory Points for the initial steps.

**IMPORTANT:** Players may no longer make any movements on the Doomsday track after:

* the Impact has occurred, or
* either the “Save Earth” or the “Seal Fate” tracker is on the final (top or bottom) slot of the Doomsday Track.

Even when any of the above is true, Experiments may still be conducted for their VP values.

### 6. CLEAN UP PHASE — CHANGES

#### B) CHECK FOR IMPACT

At the beginning of the Check for Impact phase of each Era, **roll the two Trajectory dice**, then count the total number of (-) and (+) symbols

* on the Trajectory die roll’s result;
* next to the Doomsday track slots where the “Save Earth”
and “Seal Fate” Trackers currently are.

Three things can happen based on the result:

1. **If there are more (+) symbols in total than (-)**, move the Impact tile 1 space to the right on the Timeline track if possible — the Impact will occur one Era later.
2. **If there are more (-) symbols in total than (+)**, move the Impact tile 1 space to the left on the Timeline track — the Impact will occur one Era earlier. If this would move the Impact tile behind the current Era tile, do not move the Impact tile.
3. **If the number of (-) and (+) symbols is equal**, do not move the Impact tile.

**IMPORTANT:** If the “Seal Fate” tracker is on the bottommost spot of the Doomsday track during the Check for Impact phase, do not roll the Trajectory dice - instead, place the Impact tile after the current Timeline tile (regardless of its position) and resolve the Impact immediately.

**IMPORTANT:** If the “Save Earth” tracker is on the topmost spot of the Doomsday track, the Impact’s damage to the present is completely mitigated, and the game is over — proceed to Ending the Game. **In games where Earth is saved, the Impact is never resolved, so there will be no Evacuation - try to adjust your game plan accordingly!**

### OPTIONAL RULE — PLANNED EXPERIMENTS

*These optional rules are meant for players who are already familiar with the Doomsday module, and prefer planning their Experiment Actions ahead.*

* Place the Level 2 Experiment stack face up next to the Doomsday board (instead of face down). The top Level 2 Experiment card will always be visible for everyone.
* Whenever a player claims an Experiment card, immediately replace it with the top Level 2 Experiment from the stack, until the Experiment stack runs out.
* During the Preparation phase, do not place any Level 2 Experiment cards under the Timeline.

## THE PIONEERS OF NEW EARTH MODULE

### ADVENTURES ON NEW EARTH

*It wasn’t long before the Paths realized that their powerful Exosuits could offer more than mere protection to their Workers. Through new engineering and scientific solutions, they developed methods to improve their Exosuit models with Neutronium, Uranium, Titanium, Gold, and even scientific Breakthroughs. This way, even the more dangerous areas of the Outback became accessible, with a vast amount of salvageable materials, forgotten relics of the Old World — and, of course, new dangers to face.*

The **Pioneers of New Earth** module expands Anachrony’s gameplay with a new Action, the Adventure, available on a separate mini-board. When taking this Action, players use their Exosuits to venture out of the safety of their Path capitals to face the perils of the Outback, New Earth’s harsh landscape. In order to take on these Adventures, players will need Exosuit Power, which can be obtained by upgrading their Exosuit model with Resources. Each Adventure card has a Power value, a Success result and a Failure result. In order to succeed on an Adventure, the player’s current Exosuit Power has to match or exceed the card’s Power value — otherwise, failure is inevitable.

### CHANGES IN SETUP

1. Place the **Adventure board** next to the Main board.
2. Shuffle the **Adventure cards** into two separate decks (5+ Power and 10+ Power, printed on their backs). Place the decks face down on the designated areas of the Adventure board. Place the Adventure reference card within easy reach of all players.
3. Place the **Adventure die** on the designated spot on the Adventure board.
4. After all players have chosen a Path, give them their corresponding **Exosuit Upgrade boards** and place them next to their Player boards.
5. Before choosing the 5 random Endgame Condition cards, add the **“Most Successful Adventures” card** to the card pool.

### NEW ACTION — ADVENTURE

The Pioneers of New Earth Module introduces a new Action, the Adventure. This Action allows players to undertake dangerous but rewarding missions to the far reaches of the Outback.

When you take the Adventure Action, **resolve the following steps in this order:**

1. **Count your Exosuit Power value** by adding up the Power values from your Exosuit Upgrade board and other sources.
2. **Place one of your Path markers** on the topmost free Power slot next to the Adventure space (if able). The Power value on this space is added to (or subtracted from) your total Power value. If there are no free Power slots at all, subtract 3 from your total Power value.
3. **Choose one of the two Adventure card decks**. Pay 1 Water if you choose the 5+ Power deck, or 2 Water if you choose the 10+ Power deck.
4. **Draw the top card of the chosen deck, then draw additional cards** equal to the number of Breakthroughs on your Exosuit Upgrade board. Choose one of the drawn cards, and put the rest back to the bottom of the respective deck in any order.
5. **Roll the Adventure die**, and add the rolled value to your Power value.
6. **Finally, compare your total Power value to that on the chosen Adventure card**. If your Power value is equal to or higher than that value, resolve the Success part of the Adventure card (left box), and place it next to your Player board. If it is lower, resolve the Failure part (right box) and put it back to the bottom of the respective deck.

### Worker specifics

* The Adventure Action can be taken by any Worker.

Adventure has a Hex Pool space, where any number of Workers can be placed.

### ADVENTURE CARDS

Successfully completed Adventure cards are kept next to your Player board, so you can always keep track of how many you have completed. Most Adventure cards have a one-time reward of various assets, but **some of them have permanent benefits, or even Free Actions** that can be used just like any other Free Action (once per Era). The Success box of these cards is marked with a purple color as a reminder.

When resolving an Adventure card that rewards you with (or makes you lose) multiple assets, always start from the top of the Success/Failure box and continue to the bottom. If a failed Adventure would cause you to lose an asset that you do not have, simply continue resolving the Adventure without losing anything.

Details of each Adventure card can be found in the Appendix.

**NOTE:** The box also includes an Adventure reference card with the quantities of Adventure cards with different Power values. While it does not specify what each card does, it helps you evaluate your chances of drawing cards with the right Power value.

### NEW ACTION — POWER UPGRADE

The Power Upgrade Action space is printed on your Exosuit Upgrade board. When you take this Action, place a Resource on one of the respective Resource slots at the bottom of the Exosuit Upgrade board. That Resource stays on the slot and is considered spent.

For each Resource placed this way, your Power value is permanently increased by the number associated with the Resource slot.

#### Worker specifics

* Path of Dominance: can only be taken by an Engineer.
* Path of Harmony and Progress: can be taken by any Worker.

**IMPORTANT:** For the Path of Salvation, Power Upgrade is a Free Action. It requires no Workers, but costs 1 Water to use.

**IMPORTANT:** The Path of Dominance starts the game with a Power value of 2 by default.

### NEW ACTION — SENSOR UPGRADE

The Sensor Upgrade Action space is printed on your Exosuit Upgrade board. When you take this Action,

1. Spend the Resource or Water indicated on the space.
2. Place one of your Breakthroughs on the designated slot on the Exosuit Upgrade board. **You may only have at most 1 Breakthrough of each of the three different shapes** on this slot (for a maximum of 3 Breakthroughs).
3. Receive 2 Victory Points.

**IMPORTANT:** Instead of receiving 2 Victory Points, the Path of Harmony receives 2 Exosuit Power permanently for each Breakthrough on the Exosuit Upgrade board.

The placed Breakthrough stays on the slot and is considered spent. For the remainder of the game, you may draw one additional Adventure card for each Breakthrough on your Exosuit Upgrade board whenever you take the Adventure Action.

#### Worker specifics

* Path of Harmony, Dominance and Progress: can only be taken by a Scientist.
* Path of Salvation: can be taken by any Worker.

### 6. CLEAN UP PHASE — CHANGES

#### A) RETRIEVE WORKERS

After retrieving all Path markers from the Free Action slots, also retrieve them from the Power slots next to the Adventure Action space, freeing them up for the next Era.

**NOTE:** Pioneers of New Earth with other game variants The Pioneers of New Earth module plays very well with the base game’s optional rule variants: the Alternate Timeline, the Starting Asset Draft and the Endgame Condition Draft. It can also be played with the Guardians of the Council module (described in the next chapter).

We do not recommend playing it together with the Doomsday module.

## THE GUARDIANS OF THE COUNCIL MODULE

*The certainty of the incoming asteroid impact cast a dark shadow over the years following the Day of Reminiscence. Life in the Capital became increasingly hard, with denizens working on strict rations to reinforce the city and prepare for the worst.*

*But one day, help eventually arrived from where the people least expected – the future. The Time Rift opened up once again, and an army of gigantic, self-propelled Exosuits slowly marched through it. The Guardians, as it turned out, were the parting gift of a dying World Council from an alternative future, where the impact resulted in fatal catastrophe. They left behind their doomed world - to help us save ours.*

With the Guardians of the Council module, players gain access to a new, Path-independent Exosuit type, the Guardian. When you take a World Council Action, you may permanently enlist one of the Guardians for your cause for a price. **The Guardians operate without Workers, and even have their own designated Action spaces,** where they can take a Capital Action without being contested.

### CHANGES IN SETUP

1. Place the **Guardian board** next to the Main board. Place a Guardian Exosuit marker (or a Guardian Exosuit miniature, whichever you prefer) on each of the 6 Hex spots on this board.
2. Before choosing the 5 random Endgame Condition cards, add the **“Most Guardians” card** to the card pool.
3. When playing with 2 players, cover the right World Council hex space with a Hex Unavailable tile. This hex space cannot be used in 2 player games with Guardians.

### 3. POWER UP PHASE — CHANGES

If you have one or more Guardians in your personal Exosuit supply, you may power them up instead of your Path’s regular Exosuits. The cost of powering them up (if any) is the same as that of powering up a regular Exosuit.

**NOTE:** While the maximum number of Exosuits that may be powered up during this phase is still 6, if you have at least one Guardian, the total number of Exosuits you **use** during an Era may exceed 6 under some circumstances (for example, by owning the Uranium Cores Superproject and activating it after you’ve used some of your Exosuits, thus having free hex slots on your Player board).

### ACTION CHANGES — WORLD COUNCIL

Whenever you take the World Council Action, after taking a Capital Action (if any) and potentially becoming the First Player (if you used the respective space), you may also enlist one of the Guardians from the Guardian board by paying its indicated cost.

**NOTE:** You may place a Worker on any World Council space to enlist a Guardian even if there are still available Worker spaces in all Capital Actions. In this case you do not get to perform a Capital Action (but you do also become First Player if you placed on the left space).

The only difference between the Guardians is their initial enlist cost. All Guardians cost at least one Worker (permanently assigned to remote-control it) and various other assets.

When you enlist a Guardian, place one of your Path markers on an empty slot of your choice, pay the associated cost, take the respective Guardian and place it in your personal supply, ready to be powered up later. Your Path marker stays on the slot permanently.

### 5. ACTION ROUNDS CHANGES — THE GUARDIANS

During the Action Rounds phase, the Guardians behave differently than the regular Exosuits in two ways:

1. **They do not require Workers:** Guardians can be used to take Actions without placing Workers in them. When taking an Action, the Guardians are always treated as though a Genius was placed in them.
2. **They have an Action space only they can use:** In addition to being able to use the Main board Action spaces (like regular Exosuits), they may also be placed on the hex space from which they were enlisted, marked with your Path marker. On this space, you may pay 1 Water to take a Capital Action (i.e. Construct, Recruit or Research).

**IMPORTANT:** Other players may never use the hex space marked with your Path marker, even if they have Guardians themselves. If you have multiple Guardians enlisted, it doesn’t matter which of the marked hex spaces you use.

### 6. CLEAN UP PHASE — CHANGES

#### A) RETRIEVE WORKERS

Retrieve the Guardians from the Main board just like your regular Exosuits, and also retrieve them from all Action spaces on the Guardian board marked with your Path marker.

**IMPORTANT:** Only the Guardians that were placed there during the Era are retrieved from the Guardian board - the ones not enlisted, and the players’ Path markers are not.

### ADVENTURE CARDS

Adventure cards each have a Success and a Failure part — the former is resolved if your Power value is equal to or higher than the card’s, the latter is resolved when it’s lower.

The Success part of certain Adventure cards gives an ongoing or repeatable benefit that applies for the rest of the game. These cards are marked with a purple color for easier differentiation.

Adventure rewards that cannot be taken (i.e. a building when there are no empty slots) are ignored. Taking any Adventure reward is optional.

If you would spend an asset as the result of resolving a Failed Adventure, but have less than the required amount, spend all you have of that asset. You still get all rewards listed after the asset you cannot spend.
