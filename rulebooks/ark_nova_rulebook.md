## INTRODUCTION & GOAL OF THE GAME

In Ark Nova you plan and build a modern, scientifically managed zoo. You build enclosures according to the animals’ way of life and support conservation projects to ensure the preservation of animal species.

Gathering diverse animals increases the attractiveness of your zoo, advancing you on the Appeal track and generating higher revenues. Likewise, careful stewardship of the animals allows you to support conservation projects, such as breeding programs, that lead to your advancement on the Conservation track and corresponding bonuses. These two tracks progress in opposite directions – if your counters meet, the game ends. Whoever achieves the best combination of appeal and conservation has built the most successful zoo and wins the game.

Association work in different zoo associations allows you to partner with zoos and universities around the world. Together, with specialists and sponsors, they will help you manage the various tasks needed to achieve your goals.

Both the designer and the publisher have made every effort to be realistic in the implementation of this game. In rare cases, however, concessions have been made for the sake of the game mechanics. For example, the koala has the subclass bear, which is often used colloquially, but does not correspond to reality. The same applies to the enclosure requirements.

## SETUP

### Global Setup

1. Place the **game board** in the center of the table. Take the **Break token** and place it on the start space of the Break track that corresponds to your player count. *If there are three players, place the Break token on the space marked 3.*
2. Shuffle the 9 **Bonus tiles** and place a random Bonus tile face up on each on each of the 4 blank yellow Bonus spaces on the board. Do not place any tiles on the two yellow spaces with icons. Return the remaining 5 tiles to the box. They are not used in the game.
3. Shuffle the **Zoo cards** to create a face-down deck on the game board on the space marked with TODO. Deal 6 **face-down** cards from the deck to the spaces provided on the game board (you will turn them faceup at the end of setup). This is the display.
4. Place the 2 **organizers** next to the game board as the general supply.
5. Place the **Association board** next to the game board, leaving enough room for one row of cards above and one row of
cards below the board.
   * Place 1 **partner zoo** of each continent and 1 **university** of each kind on the spaces provided on the Association board.
   * Shuffle the **Base Conservation Project cards** and place them face-down as a deck next to the Association board. In a 4-player game, place the 4 topmost cards face up **below** the board, otherwise the 3 topmost.
   * In a **2-player game,** take 6 player tokens of any unused color and cover:
      * on the face-up **Base Conservation Project** cards: the left level on the left card, the middle level on the middle card, and the right level on the right card.
      * on the **Association board:** the three spaces in the left column of the **donation area.**
  The covered levels / spaces are considered blocked and cannot be used by either player.
6. Shuffle the Final Scoring cards and place them face down next to the Association board.
7. Randomly determine a start player. Turn order is clockwise.

### Personal Setup

For your personal setup, each of you takes the following steps:

A. Take a random Map A **zoo map,** and place it with that side up in front of you. Return the remaining zoo maps to the box. They are not used in this game.

> 4 of the 8 zoo maps have Map A on one side. All 4 copies of Map A are identical and we recommend it for your first game. It allows you an easy entry into the game and offers generous rewards.
>
> The other 4 zoo maps have Map 0 on one side (they make up another identical set of 4). This map is suitable for beginners after the first game.
>
> On the other side of all zoo maps you will find Maps 1–8; these are the advanced maps. These are all different and give you an individual special ability. We recommend these maps once you are familiar with the game. When playing with these, for your personal setup, take 2 random zoo maps and choose 1 of the advanced maps. Alternatively, you could also lay out player count +1 advanced zoo maps and choose 1 each in reverse order of play. In both cases, return any unselected maps to the box.
>
> If you are already familiar with the game and are playing a game with beginners, you can give them a small starting advantage with Map 0 and a larger starting advantage with Map A.

B. Take one set of Action cards each, consisting of the card
types Build, Cards, Animals, Association, and Sponsors.
Place one card with side I up under each of the five card
slots on your zoo map: the Animals card under the slot
furthest to the left showing the 1 and the remaining
cards randomly distributed under the other 4 slots.

C. Choose a **color** and take all components of this color.

* Place the **counters** for appeal TODO, conservation TODO, and reputation TODO on the first spaces of their tracks on the game board. Place your counters on the Appeal track according to turn order: The start player starts on space **0** on the track; the second player in turn order starts on space **1;** third on space **2** and fourth, on space **3.**
* Take 7 of the **player tokens** in your color and place them on the designated spaces at the left edge of your zoo map. Keep the remaining player tokens next to your zoo map for later use.
* Take the 4 **association workers** and place 1 on the notepad of your zoo map, as the active worker, and the remaining 3 lying down on the designated spaces below the notepad.

D. Take 25 money from the supply and put it on the
notepad of your zoo map.

E. Draw 2 Final Scoring cards and place them next to your zoo map. You may look at them at any time, but make sure to keep them hidden from the other players.

F. Draw 8 Zoo cards. Choose 4 of them to keep as hand cards and discard the remaining 4 cards to a face-up discard pile on the discard space on the board. Make sure to keep your hand cards hidden from the other players.

> A face-up discard pile is easier to distinguish from the other card piles. This prevents you from unintentionally drawing the wrong card type. Of course, you can keep the discard pile face down, if you prefer.

> We recommend that you choose 1–2 Sponsor cards and 2–3 Animal cards as your first hand cards. Make sure that the cards do not have conditions you cannot fulfill early on in the game. If possible, choose cards with icons matching the Base Conservation Projects on display. Alternatively, you can also use suggested starting decks with game tips for the first moves.

G. After you have all chosen your hand cards, reveal the 6 cards on the display.

## GAMEPLAY

Ark Nova does not play in formal rounds; instead, players simply take turns (in clockwise order) taking one turn at a time until the end of the game is triggered. In addition, there are so-called *breaks* in between, when the game is put on hold for an administration phase. During these breaks you will discard cards down to your hand limit, recall workers, and gain income, among other things. The break procedure is explained in detail on page 18.

You always perform one action during your turn, which may trigger additional effects and bonuses. You perform these actions with the 5 Action cards displayed below your zoo map. You can expand your zoo, play Zoo cards, and draw new Zoo cards. The position of the Action card determines how much you can do with that action. For more details on this mechanism, see the chapter *A Turn / The 5 Action Cards* on page 8.

### Your Zoo Map

Your zoo (1) is established in the large area in the middle of your zoo map. This is where you place buildings such as enclosures (standard or special enclosures), kiosks, pavilions, or unique buildings. An overview of all enclosures shows their sizes and shapes (2).

You are not allowed to build on the rock (R) and water (W) spaces, but some animals need an enclosure next to a rock or water space. All other spaces are building spaces, meaning you can place buildings on them. A space that has been built on is referred to as covered in game terminology. You are not allowed to build on spaces with the icon until you have upgraded your Build action card (see A Turn / The 5 Action Cards on page 8 for more information).

Some spaces show a placement bonus (3). You receive the bonus indicated by the icon immediately when you cover it. The Icon overview explains all bonuses.

The left edge of your zoo map has bonus spaces that can be activated by supporting various conservation projects (4). At the beginning of the game these spaces hold 7 player tokens. Whenever you support a conservation project, you take one of these player tokens and place it on the Conservation Project card. This always gains you an immediate bonus and sometimes you gain that bonus again in each break.

The bottom of your zoo map has card slots to hold your Action cards (5). The number above each slot shows the strength of the Action card in that slot.

On the more advanced zoo maps you will find a special ability that distinguishes your zoo from all others (6). Map A, which we recommend for your first game, has the same special ability for all players. At the beginning of the game, place a 3-space enclosure on the indicated spaces, with the side showing the number 3 (the empty side) up.

### Zoo Cards

The most important components in Ark Nova are the 3 different types of Zoo cards. The individual card types will be explained in detail later.

Animal cards are used to add animals to your zoo. They require an empty enclosure and provide your zoo with appeal points.

Sponsor cards allow you to hire specialists, build unique buildings, or achieve various other effects, among other things.

With Conservation Project cards you support conservation projects to collect conservation points. Usually, you specialize in specific animal species and the continents from which they originate. In some conservation projects, you are going to reintroduce animals into the wild. In addition to the Zoo cards for conservation projects, there are also Base Conservation Project cards that are available at the start of the game.

### The Break Track

The game board has a Break track to count down the time remaining until the next break.

At the beginning of the game, and after each break, the Break token goes on the starting space corresponding to your player count (1). Whenever you advance the Break token, move it the appropriate number of spaces towards the end of the Break track. When you reach the last space of the track (2), you call a break for everyone (see page 18).

The break takes place after the end of your current turn. You get 1 X-token for reaching the last space of the Break track. Ignore any additional steps on the track (i.e. stop here). After the break, place the Break token back on the starting space of the track.

The right side of your zoo map has spaces for **partner zoos (7)** and **universities (8),** of which there are 5 and 3 different ones respectively. Note that there are partner zoos on all 5 continents, but you can only establish partnerships with a maximum of 4 of them. Whenever you establish a new partnership with a zoo or a university, place the tile on the lowest empty space of the appropriate column. To get a third partner zoo, you must first upgrade your **Association** action card (see A Turn / The 5 Action Cards on page 8 for more information). The different background color and the icon serve as reminders. If there is a bonus depicted on the space where you place your partner zoo or university, you immediately receive that bonus.

A **partner zoo** makes it easier for you to accommodate an animal from that continent in your zoo, because the cost to do so is reduced by 3 money per continent icon on the Animal card.

A **university** grants you the bonuses and icons it shows. To the right are the supply spaces for your additional association workers (9), which you place here at the beginning of the game. Just like with partner zoos and universities, you use them from the bottom to the top, except that rather than placing tiles, you remove workers. Whenever you are allowed to hire an association worker, you take one from here and place it on the notepad above as an active worker. Certain zoo maps reward you with conservation points for hiring your last worker.

All of your available association workers, money, and X-tokens are kept on the **notepad (10)** space above.

### A Turn / The 5 Action Cards

Your Action cards are located below your zoo map. Each card is always assigned to a card slot at the bottom of the map. The number on the card slot indicates the strength X with which you can use the Action card located there. The numbers range from 1 on the far left to 5 on the far right, meaning the further to the right your Action card is when you perform the action, the more powerful the action will be.

On your turn, choose one of your Action cards to perform its action, shift it to be lower than the others in the row, then perform the action of that card with a strength of X. After completing the action, remove the chosen Action card from its slot, shift all Action cards to the left of the newly empty slot to the right, and place the chosen Action card in the now-empty slot 1.

You may use X-tokens to increase the strength of an action. For each X-token you use, increase the strength X of the action by 1. Then return the token to the general supply. You can use as many X-tokens as you like in one action. With some actions, however, a strength greater than 5 no longer improves the action. You can never have more than 5 X-tokens. You set the strength of an action before you perform it. This means you can’t use X-tokens gained while performing the action to increase the strength of this action.

Some Zoo cards allow you to execute an effect “after finishing” your action. In this case, complete your action, including moving the Action cards, before executing the effect.

At the beginning of the game, all your Action cards are displayed on **side I**. If you receive a card upgrade TODO, you may flip an Action card of your choice from **side I** to **side II**. The card remains in its current card slot. Starting with your next action, you can then use that Action card to perform an improved version of the action for the rest of the game.

> There are 4 ways to upgrade one of your Action cards in the game: on the Conservation track, the Reputation
track, and when you gain your second partner zoo or your
second partner university. One of them allows you to choose
an alternative. So be aware that you cannot upgrade all of
your Action cards! In each game you will have to decide which
upgrades are most important to you.

You may not “do nothing” with your action (e.g. play 0 Animal cards or build 0 buildings).

The individual actions are explained in detail on the following pages. Here is a short overview of the actions:

#### CARDS Action (page 9)

The Cards action allows you to gain new Zoo cards (Animals, Sponsor, and Conservation Project cards) from the deck or the display.

#### BUILD Action (page 10)

Enclosures are needed to accommodate animals in your zoo. The Build action allows you to build standard enclosures for animals of all categories or special enclosures for particular animal categories. You can build kiosks and pavilions as well.

#### ANIMALS Action (page 11-13)

With the Animals action you can add animals to empty enclosures. You need to fulfill special conditions for this and pay the cost for the animal acquisition. In return, animals give you special abilities and add icons to your zoo, which you might need to support conservation projects.

#### ASSOCIATION Action (page 14-16)

With the Association action, you send your association workers to work in zoological associations. With their help, your reputation increases, you can gain universities and zoos from other continents as partners, support conservation projects, or donate to animal conservation.

#### SPONSORS Action (page 17)

The Sponsors action gains you the support of sponsors (by playing them into your zoo). They either support you directly or fund a project, such as a unique building. Many of them gain you an ongoing effect or income. At the end of the game, you can gain additional appeal or conservation points from your sponsors.

#### X-TOKEN Action (page 18)

If you find yourself in a situation in which you can’t or don’t want to perform any of the 5 actions, you may perform this alternative action to gain exactly 1 X-token. You must still select and move a card to slot 1, shifting all other cards to the right like in other actions. The strength of the slot the card is in does not contribute to this action.

### I CARDS

**Advance the Break token 2 spaces. Then draw cards from the deck OR snap.**

#### DRAWING FROM THE DECK

Compare the strength X of the action with the table on the card. Draw the indicated number of cards (maximum 3) from the deck. Then, you might have to discard a card from your hand, which can be one of the cards you have just drawn or a card already in your hand.

#### SNAPPING

If you execute the action with a strength of at least 5 , then instead of drawing several cards from the deck, you may take exactly 1 card from the display into your hand. This is called Snapping. You may take any card, regardless of the reputation of your zoo. Replenish the display at the end of your turn.

Whether you snap or draw from the deck, first advance the Break token 2 steps (do not gain any money for this). You can have any number of cards in your hand after this action, but during the break, you may need to discard cards down to your hand card limit of 3 cards (or 5 with a specific university) (see Break on page 18)

### II CARDS

**Advance the Break token 2 spaces. Then draw cards from the deck or within reputation range OR snap.**

#### DRAWING WITHIN REPUTATION RANGE

If you have upgraded the *Cards* action, you may draw cards within your reputation range, meaning from the display (up to your Reputation counter) and/or from the deck. In addition, the table printed on the card that determines the details of the action is upgraded. You may draw from the display and the deck in any order you choose, but the display is not replenished until you have completed your turn.

#### SNAPPING

If you have upgraded the Cards action, you can snap at a lower strength level, **starting** from a strength of 3. If you choose the snap option, it makes no difference whether the strength is 3 or higher.

In addition, after upgrading your *Cards* action, you may continue progressing past 9 reputation on the Reputation track.

### The Reputation Track and the Display

The game board has a display of 6 cards (see B in the example: Taking cards using side II below). Next to these cards is the Reputation track, where you keep track of the reputation of your zoo (see A in the example: *Taking cards using side II below*).

Whenever you are allowed to increase the reputation of your zoo reputation, advance your counter 1 step on this track. To increase the reputation of your zoo to 10 (or more), you must have upgraded the Cards Action card to **side II**. The TODO icon on space 10 (folder 5) serves as a reminder.

If you advance your Reputation counter to a space with a bonus next to it, you take the bonus immediately and only once. If your counter has reached space 15 on the Reputation track and your zoo keeps receiving reputation, your counter will remain on space 15 and you instead take 1 appeal for each remaining reputation step you are due.

The location of your counter determines which cards in the display are **“within reputation range”** for you. Within reputation range is the card on the same folder as your counter as well as all cards on the lower-numbered folders. This means that the higher your zoo’s reputation, the more cards there are within your reputation range.

If you have taken one or more cards from the display, **do not replenish the display until you have completed your entire turn.** Then, move cards from the higher-numbered folders down to the lower-numbered folders. Do not change the order of the cards. Finally, fill each empty space with a card from the deck.

Next to the display is the **discard pile.** You may **not** look through the discard pile during the game.

Example: Taking cards using side II
You are blue, and you are performing the action with strength 5,
which lets you take 4 cards and discard 1. Above all, you would like
to have the Lion that is within your reputation range in the display.
You take the Lion (1), draw 2 cards from the deck (2) and then decide
to also take the Caracal from the display (3). Then you discard a card
from your hand.
At the end of your action, the cards on folders 3, 5, and 6 move down
(4) and you flip over 2 new cards for folders 5 and 6 (5). If the Lion had
not been within reputation range, you would only have been able to
obtain it by snapping. In that case, you would not have been allowed
to draw any more cards, but you could have completed the action
with strength 3 or 4.
