THE NEXT FRONTIER
The earth is overpopulated. The colonization of Mars is always four decades away. Only one avenue is open for human expansion: the world under the sea.
Players compete to build the best underwater nation – an archipelago of undersea cities connected by a network of transportation tunnels. Kelp farms and desalination plants will provide your people with food and water. Laboratories will give you the knowledge you need to run everything more efficiently. Perhaps you will even be able to build symbiotic cities, fully integrated with the underwater ecosystem.
Beginning as a single city, you will expand your network, connecting it with the coastal metropolises. At a time when hunger has exceeded agricultural output and water shortages strain the bonds of the Federation of Nations, you will build a nation that is self-sustaining, perhaps even someday exporting your products to those who have been left ashore. 
This is your task. 
This is your destiny.
The world’s hopes lie in your underwater cities.

3 MARKERS IN EACH OF 4 PLAYER COLORS

GAME OVERVIEW

Players work to build underwater cities, a transportation network that connects them, and various facilities that support them. In each round, players take turns choosing an action while simultaneously playing a card. If the card matches the color of the chosen action slot, the player also gains a benefit from the card.
At three times during the game, players will deal with Production, a special phase in which their underwater network produces  points and resources while their people consume food. At the end of the game, additional points are awarded for various accomplishments and the player with the most points wins.

GAME SETUP

1. Place the main game board in the center 
of the table. The board is two-sided. The side 
shown here is used for a 3 or 4-player game. 
Use the other side for a 2-player game.
2. The various components that represent 
cities, tunnels, buildings, and resources 
should be kept in a common supply.  
If necessary, you can keep the supply  
in two places so that everyone can reach the 
components easily.
3. Cards with divers on the back are separated
into 3 decks, one for each era of the 
game. The Era II and Era III decks can be set 
aside right now. Shuffle the Era I cards face 
down and place the deck on the main game 
board, as shown. Note: Thorough shuffling 
is very important for this game. You don’t 
want same-colored cards to be clumped 
together.
4. Place the era marker on the starting 
space of the era track.
5. Place one score marker for each player 
on the zero space of the scoring track.

6. SPECIAL CARDS 
Special cards represent specialists you can hire for 
your underwater endeavors. Each has a cost near 
the upper left corner.  
 
Separate the Special cards into two groups:  
 * A group that costs one or two credits.
 * A group that costs three credits.
 
Shuffle the deck of one-or-two-credit 
Special cards and place it on the main 
board. Turn the top card face up. 
 
Shuffle the three-credit Special cards 
and deal 6 face up to the corresponding 
spaces in the center of the game board. 
Return the rest of the three-credit deck 
to the box. These 6 are the only 
three-credit Special cards that will be 
available during this game.

SETUP FOR 2 OR 3 PLAYERS

When setting up the game for fewer than four players, make two changes:
 1. Leave the action-cloning tile in the box.
 2. Use fewer symbiotic cities (purple domes):
  a. With two players, use 7 symbiotic cities. 
  b. With three players, use 10.
A four-player game uses the action-cloning tile and all 13 symbiotic city domes.


PLAY ORDER
Players take turns choosing actions. They play in the order depicted on 
the play-order track, and this order does not change during the round.  
 
A TURN
You always start your turn with 3 cards. On your turn, you play one card 
and simultaneously choose one of the available action slots. That is, 
you choose a slot that no one else has chosen this round. (There is also a 
special slot, explained later, that is always available.) You place one of your 
action tiles on the slot to indicate that you have chosen it. This makes the 
slot occupied and not available for the rest of the round.
If the color of the card you played matches the color of the slot you chose, 
you also get to perform the card’s effect. If the color does not match, you 
just take the action and discard the card with no effect – you assigned some 
personnel to the job, but it was not their area of expertise, so they just did 
the job without accomplishing any additional tasks.
At the end of your turn, you always draw 1 card. It’s also possible to draw 
additional cards as part of an action or card effect. If you end up with more 
than 3 cards, you will have to discard down to 3. You may discard any time 
before you take your next turn.
 
A ROUND
Players continue until each has taken 3 turns. As cards are played, slots 
will be occupied, making them unavailable for those who play later in the 
round. The number of available slots will diminish. When everyone has taken 
3 turns, it is the end of the round. The end of the round is described in detail 
on page [15].
 
THE ERA MARKER
At the end of each round, the era marker advances one space along the era 
track. When it reaches a Production space, there is a Production phase.
 
PRODUCTION
During Production, your underwater network will produce various resources.
At the end of Production, each of your connected cities will consume 
1 kelp. Details are on page [16].
 
AN ERA
An era consists of 4 rounds in Era I and 3 in Era II and Era III. The end of 
each Production phase marks the end of an era. New cards will come into 
play, as explained on page [16]. The game has a different deck of cards for 
each era. At the end of Era III, the game is done.
 
FINAL SCORING
At the end of the game, players score various aspects of their underwater 
network, and the player with the most points wins.

Each player chooses a color and takes the 3 action tiles, the Personal 
Assistant card and final scoring card in that color. Although the Personal 
Assistants have different illustrations, they all have the same effect.
Each player should also take a player info card.
Each player starts with 1 kelp, 1 steelplast, 1 science, and 2 credits. 
(Some players may get additional resources once order of play has been 
determined.)
   
PLAYER BOARD SETUP
Each player takes a different player board, chosen at random.
Your nation’s infrastructure begins with a city in the lower right corner 
of your board. There are two types of cities – symbiotic and nonsymbiotic.
Your starting city is a nonsymbiotic city represented by a white dome, 
as shown.
Separate the brown hexagonal metropolis tiles from the blue ones. Mix 
up the brown ones and randomly give one to each player. Then mix up 
the blue ones and randomly give two to each player.
Your brown metropolis goes on the hexagonal space in the upper left 
corner. The other two should be randomly assigned to the remaining two 
spaces. 
The player boards are two sided. For your first game, use the side 
depicted above (# 1-4, ). Later, for more variety, you can try the other 
side, which has more asymmetry (# 5-8,   ).
Two tracks determine the order of play. The play-order track shows the 
order of play for the current round. The Federation track is where players 
jockey for position for the next round.
For the first round, place the play-order markers on the play-order track 
randomly. Then, on the Federation track, the markers should be placed 
in the opposite order, as shown, and those who play third and fourth get 
additional resources. Specifically:
1. The player on space 1 of the play-order track will play first in the first 
round. On the Federation track, his or her marker will start below the 
track, on the space with the matching color.
2. The player on space 2 plays second. His or her other marker will start 
on space 4 of the Federation track.
3. The player on space 3 will also start on space 3 of the Federation track 
and will start with one extra credit.
4. The player who plays last will start on space 2 of the Federation track 
and will start with 1 credit and 1 steelplast in addition to the usual 
starting resources.
The first round is the only round that starts this way. In later rounds, play 
order and initial position on the Federation track will be determined differently.
Here is a quick summary of how the game is played:
The cards in your hand represent
personnel you have at your 
disposal. On each turn, you will play 
one of these cards as you choose 
that turn’s action. This represents 
sending your personnel out to 
complete that assignment.
You begin each turn with exactly 
3 cards. During your turn, you play 
exactly 1 of these, while simultaneously
choosing an action slot.
If the color of the card does 
not match the color of the slot, 
then you ignore the card and just 
perform the action. However, if 
the color matches, then you get 
to resolve the card before or after 
performing the action.
The three colors have different power levels:
 
Green cards are the strongest, but you get their benefits only when you 
play them on green action slots, which are the weakest.
 
Red cards and action slots have a moderate power level.
 
Yellow cards are the weakest, but the yellow action slots are the 
strongest. 

Some cards have an instant effect. All others can be claimed for later use, 
as explained below. All five types of cards are described in this section. 
PLAYER SETUP
ORDER OF PLAY

GAMEPLAY
At the start of the game, you draw 6 cards from the Era I deck. Choose  
3 to keep, and discard the other 3.
If you are new to the game, try to keep one card of each color. And don’t 
worry about this decision too much – every card offers interesting choices, 
and you will be getting more cards very soon.
PLAYER CARDS (CARDS FOR THE FIRST ROUND)
CARDS
Purple plays first. Purple‘s 
marker starts on the purple 
space below the Federation 
track. 
Orange plays second and 
starts on the fourth space 
of the Federation track. 
Blue plays third. His marker 
is on the third space of the 
Federation track, so Blue 
will start the game with 
1 extra credit. 
Black plays last, but starts 
the game on the second  
space of the Federation 
track, with an additional 
1 credit and 1 steelplast.

On your turn, you choose an action by placing one of your action tiles on an 
action slot. Slots that have already been chosen this round are occupied and 
cannot be chosen again. Slots that have not yet been chosen are available.
The two sides of the main board have different action slots. One side is de-
signed for a two -player game. The other side is designed for three or four.  
A key for action slots of each board can be found on page [20].
When you place your tile on an action slot, you must also play a card from 
your hand. The action slots and the cards come in three colors. If the color 
of your card matches the color of the action slot, you may resolve the card’s 
effect before or after you perform the slot’s action. If the colors do not 
match, you ignore the card and only perform the slot’s action. 
It is legal to use only part of an action or card effect. For example, if an 
action slot allows you to build a city and a tunnel, you can choose to build 
only the tunnel, if you wish. 
However, you are not allowed to choose an action slot without using at 
least part of its effect. For example, if you do not have enough resources to 
build 1 tunnel, you cannot choose the action slot that allows you to build  
2 tunnels.
Card effects are always optional, so it is legal to play a matching card and 
not use its effect at all.
In this section we will illustrate core gameplay concepts with action slots, 
but these rules also apply to many of the card effects as well.
 
RESOURCES
Underwater Cities has many resources that players can gain or spend.  
The gaining of a resource is represented by a simple icon:
In general, credits, science, kelp, steelplast, and biomatter are used to pay 
costs. Kelp is also used for feeding your people (there are other ways to feed 
people, but kelp is the most efficient). Cards, of course, are useful because 
they give you more choices on your turn. And points are how you win the 
game. So anything you gain is sure to be useful to you sooner or later. 
 
EXAMPLE:
The player who chooses this action slot will 
take 2 steelplast tokens and 1 kelp token 
from the supply and keep them near his or 
her player board. 
 
INSTANT EFFECTS
When you play a card with this symbol, if its color matches 
your chosen action slot, you resolve the card’s effect immediately
before or after you perform your chosen action. If the 
color does not match, you ignore the card’s effect.
In either case, these cards are discarded to the discard pile on the main 
board. 
 
CLAIMING A CARD
Four types of cards do not have instant effects. When you play such a card, 
if its color matches your chosen action slot, you claim the card by placing it 
near your player board. It thus becomes a permanent part of your underwater nation.
If the color of the card does not match the color of the slot, you cannot 
claim the card. It goes to the discard pile.
 
PERMANENT EFFECTS
Cards marked with this symbol have a permanent effect. 
You gain the card’s benefit if you claim it, as described above. 
Permanent effects take various forms. Some permanent effects
trigger whenever a certain event happens. Others might 
give you a discount in certain situations. Some offer a special 
ability that you can use every turn.
It is legal to use the permanent effect even on the turn in which you claim 
the card.
 
ACTION CARDS
Cards with this symbol are action cards. Your claimed action 
cards offer additional actions your underwater nation can 
perform. To use an action card, you must use an action slot or 
a card effect that allows you to do so.
 
It is legal to use an action card even on the turn in which you claimed it.
Each action card is limited to one use per era. After use, rotate it 
90 degrees to the right to show that it has been used and is no longer 
available. At the end of the era, after Production, all action cards are 
restored to the usual orientation to show that they will be available 
again in the new era.
Note: There are a few instant-effect cards which allow you to make 
an used action card available again. This can allow you to use an 
action card more than once in the same era.
 
LIMIT OF FOUR
You are limited to 4 action cards (and your Personal Assistant
[see on the top] counts as one of the 4). If you already 
have 4, then you must discard one before  you claim a new 
action card. The discarded card can be one that has been 
used this round or one that is still available. 
If you make room for a new action card by discarding one that is 
available, you may immediately use the discarded action. It is as though 
your new action card also came with an instant effect that lets you use the 
discarded available action card.
 
PRODUCTION CARDS
Cards with this symbol are production cards. Your claimed 
production cards take effect during the Production phase, 
which happens three times during the game. Some produce 
resources directly. Others may modify your production based 
on what is connected to your network.
 
END-SCORING CARDS
Cards with this symbol are end-scoring cards. Your claimed 
end-scoring cards can give you points at the end of the game. 
Some give you points based on some aspect of the network 
you have built. Others may allow you to convert certain re-
sources to points.
 
SPECIAL CARDS
The cards you draw from the regular deck are unknown to you until you 
draw them. But some cards start the game face up for all to see. These are 
called Special cards.
Special cards cannot be drawn in the usual way. The only way 
to get one is to use the action slot marked like this.
This action is explained on page [20].
The Special card remains in your hand. It can be played just 
like any other card. If it does not match your chosen action 
slot, then it is discarded and returned to the bottom of the Special card 
deck with no effect. If it matches, then it has an effect only if you pay the 
cost depicted near the upper left 
corner.
EXAMPLE:
The player must pay 3 credits 
to play this card if she wants its 
special benefit.
Gain 
1 steelplast.
Gain 1 credit. That is, take a 
1-credit token from the supply 
and keep it near your player 
board.
Gain

Gain 1 card. That is, draw a 
card from the current era’s 
deck. Do not take any of the 
Special cards from the board.
Gain 
1 science.
Gain 1 point. Advance your 
point marker one space on the

Gain 1 biomatter.
When you choose an action slot that 
does not match your card, gain 1 steelplast. 
This effect does not apply when you  
choose the always-available slot.

LIMITED AND UNLIMITED COMPONENTS

 Credits, kelp, steelplast, science, and biomatter tokens are 
not intended to be limited. If the supply runs low, you can use higher 
denominations and the multiplier tiles to represent the amount of 
resources you have. You can make change freely at any time.
 Building tokens are not intended to be limited. If you run out of 
a particular type, you can usually substitute a different colored token. 
For example, if players have lots of upgraded farms, the supply might 
run out of green tokens. You can get more in the supply by replacing 
the bottom tokens of some upgraded farms with a color you have 
lots of. The green token on top is sufficient to remind you that it is an 
upgraded farm.
 Tunnels and nonsymbiotic cities are limited. The supply 
starts with 47 tunnels. When they are gone, no one can build tunnels 
anymore. Similarly the game has only 17 nonsymbiotic city domes, and 
no more than this may be built.
 Symbiotic cities are limited. The limit depends on the number 
of players:
 
z In a two-player game, use 7 symbiotic city domes.
 
z In a three-player game, use 10.
 
z In a four-player game, use all 13.
 The era deck is not limited. If it runs out of cards, shuffle 
its discard pile to make a new deck.
 You should not run out of one- or two-credit Special 
cards. Whenever these are “discarded” they return immediately
 to the bottom of the deck.
 Three-credit Special cards are limited. Only six are 
available in the game.
You can organize your claimed cards by type. The icons on top allow 
you to lay them out compactly, as shown.

PERSONAL
ASSISTANT
During setup, each player received 
a Personal Assistant. This is an action card 
that is already claimed and in play at the 
beginning of the game. It follows the same 
rules as any other action card. When you 
use the action, you decide whether to gain 
1 steelplast or 1 credit. 
It could also be discarded within the 
“Limit of four” rule.

DISCARDING SPECIAL CARDS
When one- or two-credit Special cards are discarded (for example, 
when you are discarding down to your hand limit) they should be im-
mediately returned to the bottom of the Special card deck.
When you play a one- or two-credit Special card:
 
z If the color does not match the chosen action slot, return the card 
to the bottom of the Special card deck.
 
z If you choose not to pay to play the Special card, return it to the 
bottom of the Special card deck.
 
z If the color matches and you pay to play it, then you keep it.  
If it has an instant effect, keep it under your player board after 
performing the effect to ensure that it will not re-enter play.  
If it is not an instant-effect card, claim it in the usual way.
Three-credit Special cards have no way to re-enter play. Generally, 
they are too valuable to discard, but if one is discarded, you can return 
it to the box.
You may use one of your action cards.

EXAMPLE: 
If you play this instant-effect card 
on a green slot, you may use one of 
your action cards before or after 
performing the slot’s action.

may use one of your action cards 
and gain 1 steelplast.

CITIES
Cities provide the habitat for the people of your underwater nation. At the 
end of the game, every city connected to your network will be worth points. 
There are 2 types of cities.
Build a city:
Pay 2 steelplast, 1 kelp and 1 credit for a nonsymbiotic city (white dome);
or pay 1 steelplast, 1 kelp, 1 biomatter and 2 credits for a symbiotic city 
(purple dome).
When you build a city, pay the usual cost and take the corresponding dome 
from the supply. Place the dome on an empty city site on your player board. 
The site you choose for your new city must be adjacent to an existing city. 
In other words, the new city must have a tunnel site that could connect it to 
an existing city. It is legal to build new cities before building the connecting 
tunnels.
Symbiotic cities are a little more expensive (biomatter is difficult to get) 
but they can produce points during Production. Nonsymbiotic cities are 
a little easier to build (if you have the steelplast) but they do not produce 
points. Both kinds of cities can give you points at the end of the game, and 
both require kelp to feed them at the end of Production.  Whenever a rule or 
effect applies to a city, that means “a symbiotic or nonsymbiotic city.”
 
BUILDINGS
Buildings are special facilities that help to make your underwater nation 
self-sufficient. You can build 3 types of them:
 
z Build a farm. This costs 1 kelp.
 
z Build a desalination plant. This costs 1 credit.
 
z Build a laboratory. This costs 1 steelplast.
When you build a building, pay the cost (which is depicted on your player 
info card) and take a token of the corresponding color from the supply. 
Place the building token on an empty building site. The site you choose for 
your new building must be adjacent to an existing city or adjacent to  
a site on which you could build a new city.
The different buildings produce different things during Production. They 
will produce more if they are upgraded (upgrades are explained on page 
[12]). Also, certain cards may have a conditional effect that only applies if 
you have certain buildings. Buildings have none of these beneficial effects 
until they are connected to your network. To connect them, you will need to 
build tunnels and cities. See YOUR NETWORK on the opposite page.
 
TUNNELS
Tunnels connect your cities to your underwater network.
Build a tunnel. This 
costs 1 steelplast and 
 
1 credit.
When you build a tunnel, pay the cost and take a tunnel tile from the sup-
ply. Place it on a tunnel site with the non-upgraded side up. The tunnel in 
the illustration above is non-upgraded.
The site you choose for your new tunnel must be connected to your 
starting city. Tunnels are connected if you can trace a path along the 
tunnels back to your starting city. The path can go through cities or through 
empty city sites, but not through empty tunnel sites. 
STEP-BY-STEP EXPANSION
You build your tunnels, buildings, and cities one-at-a-time. For exam-
ple, if you choose this action slot, you first build one tunnel on a legal 
tunnel site and this could open up one or more new legal sites for the 
second tunnel.
COSTS
The usual cost for building a city, building, or tunnel is depicted on your 
player info card. This is the cost you pay when you build something by 
choosing an action slot.
Certain card effects also allow you to build things. If the card does not 
specify a cost, you pay the usual cost. However, if the card specifies  
a cost, you pay that cost instead of the usual cost.
EXAMPLE:
The cities, buildings, and tunnels on this 
player board have all been built legally. 
Possible sites for the next new city are 
highlighted in green. If the player were to 
build a city in the upper left corner, then 
the remaining two city sites would 
immediately become legal to build on.
The city site in the lower left 
corner is a legal site for a new city. 
Therefore, its empty building sites 
are legal sites for new buildings. 
The player has already built a 
[laboratory] on one of these 
building sites. 
EXAMPLE: 
Legal sites for a new tunnel are high-
lighted in green. Note that all three 
existing tunnels are connected to 
the starting city, as required. 
EXAMPLE:
The city in the middle and its building 
are not connected because there is 
no tunnel leading to the city. The 
building in the lower left corner is not 
connected because it has no city. 
Everything else is connected and 
thus part of the network.
 
YOUR NETWORK
We have seen that tunnels must be connected to your starting city, but 
buildings and cities do not have to be. This gives you freedom in how you 
choose to expand. However, you eventually want everything on your board 
to be connected to your network.
Your network is all the structures and cities and empty city sites that are 
connected to your starting city:
 
z By definition, your starting city is always connected to your network.
 
z All your tunnels are automatically connected to your network because 
building a tunnel that is disconnected is not legal.
 
z A city is connected to your network if there is a chain of tunnels from 
it to your starting city. Because all your tunnels are connected, any city 
with a tunnel leading to it is connected and a city with no tunnels is not 
connected.
 
z A building adjacent to a connected city is connected to your network.

Buildings and cities that are not connected do not produce during 
Production. They do not consume kelp at the end of Production. They do 
not count during final scoring.
EXPANSION SITES
Each city has an additional building 
site that is generally off limits. You 
can build on this site only if you play  
a card with an effect that specifically 
allows you to build on an expansion 
site (and only if it is adjacent to an 
existing city or a site on which it is 
legal to build a new city).
Biomatter is a remarkable substance, somewhat more rare than the other resources.
In addition to being essential for building symbiotic cities, biomatter can also be 
a universal building material. Only when building a tunnel, building, or city, any part 
of the cost that requires kelp or steelplast can be paid with biomatter instead.
EXAMPLE:
A nonsymbiotic city normally costs 2 steelplast, 1 kelp, and 1 credit. But you could 
build it with  1 steelplast, 2 biomatter, and 1 credit.

The always-available slot allows you to 
gain 2 cards and 2 credits.
Note: Some Special card effects allow 
you to use the action depicted at an action 
slot. These effects apply only to the colored 
slots, not to the always-available slot.
 
THE ACTION-CLONING TILE (4 PLAYERS)
4
In a four-player game, the 
important action slots become 
occupied quite quickly. The 
action-cloning tile (which is 
available only in a four-player 
game) gives players a second 
chance at one of these slots.
On your turn, instead of choosing an available action slot, you may do the 
following:
1. Pay 1 credit.
2. Take the action-cloning tile.
3. Choose an action slot occupied by another player.
Your action tile goes on the slot you chose, on top of the other player’s tile. 
You also play a card, as usual, and you gain the benefits of the card if its 
color matches the chosen slot. Note that you cannot choose a slot that is 
already occupied by your tile.
Note on card effects: In a four-player game, “any slot occupied by another 
player” actually means “any occupied slot not occupied by you”. The idea is 
that if you have already placed a tile on that slot, a card that allows you to 
use “any slot occupied by another player” will not allow you to use that slot 
again. So a slot occupied by you and another player does not count as a “slot 
occupied by another player”.
 
ONE-TIME USE
Once the action-cloning tile is used, it cannot be used again for the rest 
of the round. The player who used the tile keeps it as a reminder that this 
option is no longer available. The tile is returned to its place on the main 
board at the end of the round.
 
SUMMARY OF CHOOSING AN ACTION SLOT
1. Place one of your action tiles on an unoccupied action slot or on the 
always-available slot.
2. Play a card from your hand.
3. If the color of the card does not match the color of the slot, perform 
the action and discard the card with no effect. The always-available 
slot has no color and cannot be matched.
4. If the color of the card matches, then you choose one of these:
a. Either perform the action, and then resolve the card’s effect.
b. Or resolve the card’s effect first, and then perform the action.
Some effects have multiple parts. The parts of an effect can be resolved in 
any order.
This action allows you:
1.  Use one of your action cards
2.  Build a structure for its usual price
3.  Pay 1 science to upgrade just built 
structure
We have already mentioned this action and it means, that you may build 
any structure for its usual price and then to upgrade it immediately by 
paying  1 science. In addition you can use one of your action cards. Accord-
ing to the order of playing individual parts of this action, you can first use an 
action card which gives you for example 1 credit and then you can pay this 
credit and 1 science to build and immediately upgrade desalination plant. 
Be careful!! You must resolve all card effects and then all actions from 
an action slot or vice versa. Resolving these 2 sets of actions 
simultaneously is not allowed.

EXAMPLE:
Suppose, that you have card with permanent effect no. 37 and action 
card no. 34 and you decide to play a card to the red action slot described 
above. In your supply you´ve got 1 steelplast and 1 science. You don´t have 
any credits, but you would like to build a desalination plant. Here is the 
description of how to do this with the resources and cards you have. First 
of all, pay 1 steelplast and build a laboratory. You have built your laboratory 
to a connected city and it is the second one, so because you claimed card 
no. 37 before you gain 1 credit immediately. Then you have to pay 1 science 
and upgrade the laboratory  you´ve just built (the whole action has to be 
performed i.e. “build and upgrade” not just “build” or just “upgrade”). Now 
you can resolve the other part of the action slot that allows you to use one 
of your action cards . You will pay 1 credit, which you´ve gained  to build a 
desalination plant. And then you draw a card.  
 
UPGRADING STRUCTURES
Buildings and tunnels are called structures in this game. Structures are 
different from cities in that structures can be upgraded. There is a card 
that will let you turn a nonsymbiotic city into a symbiotic city, but this is an 
exception.
To upgrade, you need a card or action slot with a depiction like this:
Whether upgrading a tunnel, a farm, a desalination plant, or a laboratory, 
the usual cost is 1 science. However, the card effects offer you  special cost 
opportunities.
When you upgrade a building, take the corresponding 
token from the supply and stack it atop the structure you 
are upgrading. To upgrade a tunnel, flip the tile over to the 
upgraded side.
An upgraded tunnel still counts as a 
tunnel, an upgraded farm still counts as a 
farm, etc. It is not possible to upgrade any 
structure that is already upgraded.
Upgraded structures produce more during Production, and certain cards 
may provide benefits for having upgraded structures.
 
THE FEDERATION TRACK
We have explained how to build your underwater nation, but you also 
need to build a good reputation with the world government! You do that 
by choosing actions or playing cards with this symbol: 
Advance 1 space on the Federation track.
Before the first round, players’ markers are placed on 
separate spaces of the Federation track in reverse play 
order, as explained on page [6]. At the beginning of 
subsequent rounds, the markers begin below space 4, as 
explained on page [15]. 
When an action slot or card effect allows you to advance 1 space on this 
track, move your marker 1 space ahead. If there is a bonus depicted beside 
that space, immediately gain the depicted resource. If you move ahead 
more than 1 space, gain the bonus of each of those spaces.
If your marker ends up on an occupied space, place it atop the other mark-
ers which are already there (being atop other markers means you will play 
ahead of them in the next round).
Even when you have advanced as far as possible, you can still gain benefits 
from “advancing” more. If you advance when you are already on space 1, put 
your marker atop any others on space 1 and score 1 point for each space you 
were supposed to advance.
EXAMPLE:
Orange takes an action allowing her to advance 2 spaces. She moves ahead 
only 1 space, because that is the end of the track. However, she scores  
2 points: 1 for moving onto that space and 1 for “advancing” off the track.  
Her marker is placed atop any other markers that are already on space 1.
 
DRAWING SPECIAL CARDS
This symbol indicates that the action slot allows you to take a 
Special card. Many Special cards are available face up in the 
center of the game board.
When you take a Special card, you either:
 
z Take one of the three-credit Special cards (it is not replaced).
 
z Or take the top card from the deck (the one-or-two-credit deck) and 
turn the next card face up.
 
z Or turn the top card face down, move it to the bottom of the deck, and 
draw the next 3 cards. Choose one of these 3 to keep and return the 
other 2 to the bottom of the deck in either order. Then turn up the new 
top card.  
 
z Once a Special card is in your hand, it is mostly like any other card. The 
differences are discussed on page [8].
 
USING ACTION CARDS
Action cards are a certain type of card you claim and keep near your player 
board. They have actions which can be used during the game, but only when 
you use an action slot or a card effect with this symbol:
You may use 1 of your action cards.
The rules for using action cards are on page [8].
 
THE ALWAYS-AVAILABLE SLOT
One action slot is always available, even if another player has already cho-
sen it this round. It has no color, so when you choose it you ignore the effect 
of the card you play.
ą
Upgrade 1 structure. Pay 1 science.
TIMING
Build a farm or a desalination plant 
for the usual cost. Gain 1 card.
BUILD FARM OR DESALINATION PLANT
34
Whenever you build a connected city‘s  
second laboratory, gain 1 credit.
BIOMECH CONSTRUCTION CREW
PLACING OF THE ACTION TILE.
THIS ACTION SLOT IS OCCUPIED.
PLAYER PERFORMS ACTION 
IN UPPER PART OF ACTION SLOT.
Use 1 of your action cards. Pay 
the usual cost to build a structure.
Pay 1 science to upgrade the 
structure you just built.   
[3-4 players]
Gain 2 science; or upgrade 1, 2, 
or 3 structures, paying 1 science 
for each upgrade. 
 The structures do not all have to 
be the same type. 
[1 – 4 players]
Gain 2 cards. Upgrade 1 structure 
by paying 1 science or gain 1 kelp. 
[2 players]

In this case there are two limitations with regard to resolving effects:
1. If a new effect triggers, resolve it immediately, even if you haven’t 
finished the effect which triggered it (as with card no. 37 above).
2. You have to resolve a card effect and the action of the chosen action 
slot separately and completely before resolving the other. 
EXAMPLE:
Kate chooses this red action and plays this red card no. 28. She also has this 
action card no. 19, which she claimed on an earlier turn.
Suppose she has 1 steelplast, 1 credit, 1 science, no kelp, and no upgraded 
tunnels. She is on space 4 of the Federation track.
The Seafood Collection effect is of no use to her until she has an upgraded 
tunnel, so she decides to resolve the action slot first. The action slot allows 
her to build and upgrade a tunnel. She pays 1 steelplast and 1 credit to build 
it and 1 science to upgrade it. She can’t use Seafood Collection now because 
she has not completely resolved the action slot’s effect.
The other part of the action slot’s effect allows her to use her Build A Structure
card. Kate has no resources for building, but she can use the second 
part of the effect first. Kate advances 1 space on the Federation track. She 
immediately gains 1 credit (effects on the Federation track are also triggered 
effects which must be resolved immediately). Now she can spend that credit 
to build a desalination plant, using the first part of the action card’s effect. 
Both parts have been resolved, so the action card is resolved. And thus, the 
entire action slot has now been resolved.
Now, and only now, can she use Seafood Collection. She has an upgraded 
tunnel, so she gains 1 kelp.
There was no way for her to use this kelp to build a farm instead of a desalination
plant. The action slot and all its triggered effects had to be resolved 
completely before she could use her card.
Of course it would have been legal to use the Seafood Collection card before 
considering the action slot. In Kate’s situation, it would have been useless, 
but if she had already built an upgraded tunnel on an earlier turn, she could 
have gained the kelp before resolving the action slot.
Your player board depicts certain bonuses you may gain from building. 
Every board offers different bonuses. When you build a structure or a city 
on a site marked with a resource, you gain the resource. 
 Building on a site marked with this       
symbols allows you to advance 1 space 
on the Federation track and draw one 
card from current Era deck.
You gain the bonus even if the city or building you build on that site is not 
yet connected to your network. These bonuses are triggered effects, which 
are resolved immediately, even in the middle of an action:
EXAMPLE:
Suppose you can legally build on the site 
shown here. You choose the action that 
allows you to build 2 tunnels. You pay 
1 steelplast and 1 credit to build on this site and immediately gain 1 steelplast. 
You may use this steelplast (and 1 more credit) to build your second tunnel. 
 
METROPOLISES
You also gain benefits from expanding your network out to connect with 
coastal metropolises.
To connect this metropolis, you need to build a tunnel on the adjacent 
tunnel site.
To connect this metropolis, you need to build tunnels on both adjacent 
tunnel sites. 
The metropolis tiles offer various benefits that apply only if the metropolis
is connected. Your brown metropolis can give you points during final 
scoring. The blue ones either have an instant effect or an instant effect and 
a production effect.
At the end of your turn you always draw 1 card. This is in addition to any 
cards you may have acquired during your turn. Because you played only 
1 card, you now have at least 3.
If you have more than 3 cards, you must discard down to 3. However, 
you can think about this decision while others are playing. Officially, this 
decision is made at the beginning of your next turn. In practice, it is okay to 
discard as soon as you have made up your mind.
During the course of one round, each player will get three chances to play 
a card while choosing an action slot. The action slots will fill up with action 
tiles. At the end of the round, everything needs to be reset.
1. Return all action tiles to their owners. 
4 players: In a four-player game, the player who took the action-cloning
tile should return it to the middle of the table at this time.
2. Reorder the play-order markers according to the order of the markers 
on the Federation track. The player farthest ahead on the Federation
track will go first next round. The next player will go next, etc. If 
markers are in a stack, each marker is ahead of any markers below it. 
Among markers below space 4, relative play order does not change.
3. Once you have determined the next round’s play order, place all Federation
track markers on the colored spaces below space 4.
4. Advance the era marker. If this is the end of the era, there will be a 
Production phase before the next round.
Note: Be sure to determine the new play order even if this is the end of the 
final round. This final order is the tie-breaking order.
EXAMPLE:
It is the end of round 2. Black and Blue did not advance on the Federation 
track, so they will go last in round 3. Their relative order does not change, so 
Black will play ahead of Blue. On space 2, the tiebreaker is the order of the 
stack. Because Orange is on top, Orange will go first. 
TIMING OVERVIEW
The era marker moves one space on the era track at the 
end of each round. After 4 rounds, it will move onto a 
Production space, reminding you that it is time for your 
first Production phase. The second Production phase 
happens 3 rounds later. The final Production phase 
happens 3 rounds after that, just before final scoring. In all, you will play 
10 rounds and have 3 Production phases. Each Production phase marks the 
end of an era.
 
YOUR NETWORK’S PRODUCTION
All players can handle their Production simultaneously. Every tunnel 
adjacent to a city and every building in your network will produce some-
thing. Upgraded structures will produce more. Symbiotic cities will produce 
2 points!
Nonsymbiotic cities have no production of their own, but they are still 
useful because they connect buildings to your network.
You also gain a slight production bonus when you have 2 upgraded buildings
of the same type at the same city.
The production of your network is depicted on your player info card.
 
THINGS THAT DO NOT PRODUCE
 
z A city will not produce if it is not connected to your network.
 
z A building will not produce if it is not adjacent to a connected city.
 
z A tunnel will not produce if it is not adjacent to a city (a tunnel 
connecting a metropolis with a Production effect will allow the 
metropolis to produce, but the metropolis does not help the tunnel 
produce).
Think of it like this: The connected cities are the places where people can 
live. It is the people who are doing the productive work. So a disconnected 
city will not produce because no one lives there – they can’t move in until 
you complete a tunnel to it. Similarly, a building next to an empty city site or 
a building next to a disconnected city does not have anyone there to run the 
operation. And tunnels that are not attached to any of your cities do not see 
enough traffic to produce.
 
PRODUCTION FROM CARDS AND METROPOLISES
 If you have claimed any production cards, or if 
you have connected your network to any 
metropolises with a production effect, you apply 
their effects at this time. When evaluating a 
production effect that depends on your cities 
or buildings, you always ignore cities and 
buildings that are not attached to your network.
Some production cards have no production of their own. 
Instead, they can modify the production of your tunnels, buildings,
and cities. Such cards are evaluated when your network 
produces, and they do not apply to tunnels, buildings, and 
cities that do not produce.

BONUSES FROM BUILDING
END OF TURN
END OF THE ROUND
PRODUCTION

EXAMPLE:
Each farm next to a connected city pro-
duces 1 kelp.

EXAMPLE:
If this farm next to connected city is 
upgraded, it also produces 1 point.

EXAMPLE:
If you have at least 2 upgraded 
farms at the same connected city, 
they will also produce 1 additional 
kelp and 1 additional point.


 
FEEDING CITIES
At the end of Production, each city in your network must be fed 1 kelp (sym-
biotic cities have the same requirements as nonsymbiotic cities). Return 
this kelp to the general supply. If you have more cities than you have kelp, 
you spend all your kelp to feed those you can and then feed the remaining 
cities according to this chart:
For each unfed city, pay 1 biomatter. If any cities are still unfed, you feed 
them by paying points – 3 points per city at the end of each Production. If 
you lose all your points and still have unfed cities, just leave your scoring 
marker at 0, but it would be extremely unlikely to lose this many points 
unless you are deliberately trying to do so.
Only cities in your network require food. Cities that are not connected do 
not count as cities because they do not have people in them yet.
 
FINAL SCORING
Your underwater nation will score points throughout the course of the 
game, sometimes as the effect of certain cards, and sometimes during 
Production. At the end of the game, you may score points for a metropolis 
you have connected to or for specific cards you have claimed. And finally, 
you will score points for the overall composition of your network and for 
your resources.
The order of final scoring is depicted on your final scoring card.
 
END OF THE ERA
After everyone has resolved all production from all sources, it is time to 
resolve the end of the era with the following steps:
1. Rotate your action cards to the usual orientation to show they can be 
used in the next era (this step is unnecessary at the end of the final 
era).
2. Feed your cities (explained on the right).
3. Remove the old era’s deck and discard pile from the game. Players keep 
any cards from that era that they currently have, but no more new 
ones will be drawn.
4. Shuffle the next era’s deck and place it on the game board. This is the 
new draw pile. Each player draws 3 cards from the new era, adding 
them to any cards already in hand. From this hand of 6 or more cards, 
choose 3 to keep and discard the rest. (Discarded cards from the 
new era go to the discard pile. Discarded cards from the previous era 
should be returned to that era’s deck.) Skip this step at the end of the 
final era.
5. Advance the era marker.
Once everyone has discarded down to 3 cards, you are ready to play the 
next era with the new deck; or if you have completed the third era, you are 
ready for final scoring.
 
FINAL-SCORING TILE
The metropolis in the upper left corner of your 
player board will give you points if you have 
connected it to your network with both tunnels.
 
END-SCORING CARDS
 
TRADE SURPLUS
185
Cards marked with this symbol can give you points at the 
end of the game. Some cards reward you for certain 
accomplishments. Others let you spend resources to buy 
points. You should spend as much as you can – there is 
nothing else you can buy, and buying points via a card is 
always more efficient than keeping the resources and 
converting them into points after everything else has been 
scored.
 
SCORING YOUR NETWORK
Your points are based on the number of different buildings next to each 
connected city:
 
z 2 points for a connected city with no buildings.
 
z 3 points for a connected city with 1 type of building.
 
z 4 points for a connected city with 2 types of buildings.
 
z 6 points for a connected city with all 3 types of buildings.
 
SCORING YOUR RESOURCES
Now, many of your remaining resources can be converted to points:
1. First, sell all your biomatter for 2 credits each.
2. Then buy 1 point for every 4 credits, kelp, science, or steelplast you 
spend, in any combination. (For example, 3 kelp and 1 steelplast is  
1 point; 1 science, 2 steelplast, and 1 credit is 1 point; etc.)
Leftover resources do not count. Convert all that you can, and ignore the 
remainder.
WINNING THE GAME
Whoever has the most points wins. If there is a tie, break the tie according to the tie-breaking play order that was determined at the end of 
the final round (politics pays).
But regardless of who has the most points, take the time to appreciate the extensive network of underwater cities you have built.  
Because of your efforts, millions of people now have food, water, and shelter. Great work!


FINAL SCORING
HAND LIMIT SUMMARY:
You must discard down to 3 cards at the beginning of your 
turn and at the beginning of each era. At any other time, it 
is okay to have more than 3.
If a card increases your hand limit by one, then you must 
discard down to 4 cards at the beginning of your turn and 
at the beginning of each era. It is still possible that you 
will start one or more turns with only 3 cards, because 
this effect only alters the way you discard, not the 
way you draw.
UNDERSEA SERVER FARM

The two farms produce 2 kelp.  
The upgraded farm also produces 1 point.
The two desalination plants produce 
2 credits. Neither has been upgraded,  
so they produce no biomatter.
Two upgraded laboratories at the same city 
produce 3 steelplast and 2 science.
Three tunnels are adjacent to cities, so 
they produce 3 credits. One is upgraded, 
so it also produces 1 point. The fourth 
tunnel is not adjacent to a city. It produces 
nothing, but it does connect the metropolis to the network.
The symbiotic city is connected to the 
network, so it produces 2 points.
The production card produces 1 credit.
One metropolis is connected to the net-
work. It produces 2 points.
After counting up production, the player 
must feed all cities connected to the 
network. Only two are connected, so the 
player pays 2 kelp.
The unconnected city is ignored during 
Production. Because no one lives there, its 
laboratory does not produce anything and 
it requires no kelp.

FINAL-SCORING EXAMPLE:
1. Because the brown metropolis is connected to the network by 2 tunnels, it can give points. Looking at the players‘ upgraded structures, we see 2 connect-
ed farms, 3 connected desalination plants, 3 connected laboratories, and 3 tunnels adjacent to cities. This counts as 2 full sets of qualifying upgraded 
structures, so the metropolis gives 8 points.
2. The player has 2 end-scoring cards that allow her to buy points. She spends 6 science to buy 9 points. She spends two pairs of kelp and steelplast to buy  
2 points. This is 11 total points from end-scoring cards.
3. Now she counts points for cities and their structures. She scores 6 points for each city with 1 building of each type. 
A
She has 2 of these, so that‘s 12 points. B
 Her city with two types of buildings is worth 4 points. C
 Her city with one type of building is worth 
3 points. D
 And her city with no buildings is still worth 2 points because it is connected. Her unconnected city E
 is ignored. No one lives there, so 
it cannot give her points. In total, her cities give her 21 points. 
4. Her leftover resources can be converted to credits, or she can do this in her head. She has 16 credits, plus 2 more for steelplast, plus 1 more for science, 
plus 6 more for biomatter because those count as 2 credits each. Total credits is 25, which converts to 6 points. 1 credit is left over, but it will be ignored. 
 If a tiebreaker is necessary, it is determined by what her position was on the Federation track at the end of the final round.
 
Players sometimes overlook the following details:
 * The number of symbiotic city domes available in the game depends on 
the number of players – two players, 7 domes; three players, 10 domes; 
four players, 13 domes.
 * You play in the order shown on the player-order track. This usually 
means you are not playing in clockwise order.
 * If you claim an action card and you already have 4 action cards, then 
you must discard one of the old ones. If you discard an available action 
card in this situation, you may use its action immediately. 
 * When you build a structure or city, you can use biomatter as a replacement
for kelp and steelplast.
 * Special cards do not have a discard pile. One-or two-credit Special 
cards return to the bottom of the deck if they are discarded. Discarded 
three-credit Special cards simply leave the game.
 * When you pay to play a Special card with an instant effect, it does not 
return to its deck. Instead, you keep it under your player board.
 * During Production, tunnels produce only if they are adjacent to a city.
 
1) GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
Use these cards to give your game intermediate 
goals that players can compete for. Shuffle the deck 
of contract cards and draw 3 at random. Place them 
on the spaces of the main board at the beginning of 
the game. Return the remaining cards to the box.
During play, any player may claim a government con-
tract as soon as he or she meets all its criteria. The player keeps the card 
and immediately gains its benefits. Claimed contracts are not replaced.
 
2) THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLAYER BOARDS 
The other side of the player boards is for experienced players. The cities 
have variable numbers of building sites. The black-and-red sites are places 
where you must pay surcharges - extra resources  to build. They can give 
you immediate bonuses or increased production. If you decide to try this 
other side, everyone in the game should use it.
 
SURCHARGES
Some sites may have surcharges for building on them  (these are not on 
the side of the player board recommended for your first game). A sur-
charge is applied after any discounts or cost reductions you may have. 
For example, if an effect allows you to build on a site for free, you still must 
pay the surcharge if you choose a site that has one.
The surcharge applies only to building on the site – it does not also apply to 
upgrading.
 
PRODUCTION MULTIPLIERS
Production multipliers indicate that the usual level of 
production is produced multiple times. More specifically, 
the two-times multiplier shown on the side means that the 
structure produces the usual amount one extra time. For 
example, two upgraded desalination plants at a connected 
city will normally produce 3 credits and 2 biomatter. If one of them has this 
multiplier, it will produce an additional 1 credit and 1 biomatter, for a total of 
4 credits and 3 biomatter. 
As you can see from the example, the multiplier 
applies to the usual production of an upgrade, but 
not to any additional production associated with 
the site.
Multipliers are not applicable outside the Production
phase. For example, if a Trial Run allows you to gain the production 
from an upgraded desalination plant with this multiplier, you gain only 
1 credit and 1 biomatter. But during Production, it will produce 
2 credits and 2 biomatter.
 
3) SOLO GAME
To play Underwater Cities by yourself, use the 
advanced side of a player board and the two-player 
side of the main board. The number of symbiotic 
domes is not limited in this variant. Set up the game 
as you would for two players, except do not use this 
metropolis tile (shown here).
Take three tiles in a non-player color and use them 
to occupy the rightmost action slot (first slot, if you 
move around clockwise) of each color. Next time you 
can occupy second, third etc. action slot of each color. You are going “first”, 
so your marker should start below space 4 of the Federation track. You will 
not need your player-order track marker.
 
GAMEPLAY
Play your round as usual. At the end of each round, you take back your 
action tiles and move all non-player action tiles one space clockwise.
If you did not advance on the Federation track, play your next round with  
a fourth occupied slot determined by this way:
1. Flip over the top card of the current era’s deck. Add its digits together 
to get a number.
2. Starting with the first green action slot (as “1”) count around clockwise 
until you get to that number. Place the new action tile on that slot,  
if it is empty, otherwise, move the action tile clockwise to the first 
empty slot.
The 3 non-player tiles of the same color always move one space clockwise. 
The fourth tile is always placed randomly, and only if you did not advance on 
the Federation track during the round.
 
GOAL
You win if you finish with at least 7 connected cities and at least 
 100 points. Track your score and try to beat your previous best.
Note: It is not possible to play the solo game with the government con-
tracts. 
 
z ANY AVAILABLE SLOT: This includes the always-available slot.
 
z ANY SLOT OCCUPIED BY ANOTHER PLAYER: This is any occupied 
slot, except those occupied by your action tiles. This does not 
include the always-available slot, because it is never considered 
to be occupied.  In a four-player game, a slot occupied by you and 
another player does not count as a slot occupied by another player 
(because it is occupied by you).
 
z AT THE END OF THE GAME, GAIN 1 POINT FOR EVERY 3 CONNECTED 
FARMS YOU HAVE: As above, count up all your connected farms, 
divide by three, and round down. That´s how many points you gain.
 
z BUILD: Anything you build must be built on a legal site.
 
z BUILDING: A building is a farm, desalination plant, or laboratory. 
Tunnels and cities are not buildings.
 
z CITY: If it is not otherwise specified, this refers to nonsymbiotic 
cities and symbiotic cities.
 
z CONNECTED: This always means “connected to your network”. For 
example, “If you have at least 3 connected desalination plants ...” 
means that the effect will trigger only if the desalination plants are 
in your network. Your network is explained on page [11].
 
z DISCOUNT: If it is not otherwise stated, the discount is subtracted 
from the usual cost. However, it is legal to apply several discounts 
and to combine them with a card that lets you pay a special cost. 
Discounts cannot take a cost below “free”. For example, if you  
have a discount of 2 credits on a tunnel that costs 1 credit and  
1 steelplast, you treat it as a discount of 1 credit and simply pay 
1 steelplast.
 
z DURING PRODUCTION, 1 BIOMATTER PRODUCED: If you have nothing
that produces biomatter during Production, this effect cannot 
be applied.
 
z DURING PRODUCTION, YOU PRODUCE AN ADDITIONAL 1 KELP FOR 
EVERY 3 CONNECTED LABORATORIES: Count up the total number 
of laboratories connected to your network. Divide by three. Round 
down. That’s how much kelp you gain.
 
z EXCHANGE: This is just like paying, except the effect can work 
either way. For example, you may pay 1 kelp to gain 1 steelplast or 
pay 1 steelplast to gain 1 kelp. You cannot exchange more than the 
specified amount. For example, a card that allows you to exchange 
1 for 1 does not allow you to exchange 2 for 2.
 
z EXPANSION SITE: Each city has a special building site that can 
only be built on if you play a Survey card. Expansion sites follow the 
usual rules – the chosen expansion site must be adjacent to a city 
or to a city site on which it is legal to build.
 
z FARM, DESALINATION PLANT, LABORATORY, TUNNEL: Upgraded 
structures still count as structures. For example, an upgraded farm 
counts as a farm.
 
z FOR FREE: If a cost is free, the card will say so. Once a cost is free, 
discounts have no further effect.
 
z GAIN THE PRODUCTION FROM 1 UPGRADED STRUCTURE ADJACENT
TO A CONNECTED CITY: Pick one upgraded structure at  
a connected city. On your player info card, look up what one of 
those, by itself, produces. Gain those resources. This does not 
impact on its production during the Production phase.
 
z IF YOU ARE ON THE THIRD SPACE OF THE FEDERATION TRACK: 
This applies if your marker is on the space with the 3. This does not 
apply if your marker is on any other space.
 
z MAY: A card’s effect is always optional. On certain cards, such as 
those that require payment for an instant effect, we use the word 
“may” to remind you of this rule, but the effect is optional even 
when the word is not used.
 
z ONCE PER TURN: This always refers to your turn. There are no 
cards that refer to other players’ turns or other players’ boards.
 
z PAY: Many cards allow you to pay a cost to get a benefit. As you 
would expect, if you can’t pay the cost, you do not get the benefit 
(however, you may play the card with no effect). If not otherwise 
specified, you pay the cost and gain the benefit only once. Cards 
that allow you to pay more to gain more will say so.
 
z PERFORM THE ACTION IN A SLOT: This allows you to perform 
a second action. You do not play an action tile on this second slot 
and you do not play a second card.
 
z SPECIFIED COST: Some cards specify how much you pay to build 
a structure or city. In this case, you do not pay the usual cost; you 
pay the specified cost instead.
 
z STRUCTURE: A structure is a farm, desalination plant, laboratory, 
or tunnel. Cities are not structures.
 
z USUAL COST: The usual cost is the cost printed on your player info 
card. It is the cost you usually pay to build the structure or build the 
city.
 
z WHENEVER AN ACTION SLOT GIVES YOU AT LEAST 1 STEELPLAST, 
GAIN 1 POINT: If the slot allows you to choose between gaining 
steelplast and doing something else, you gain the point only if you 
choose to gain the steelplast. The effect is not triggered by steelplast
gained from other sources. For example, the action slot that 
allows you to advance 2 spaces on the Federation track cannot trig-
ger this effect, not even if the advancement gives you 1 steelplast.
 
z WHENEVER YOU BUILD A CONNECTED CITY’S SECOND LABORATORY:
If it is not connected, the effect will not trigger. A third 
laboratory will not trigger this effect.
 
z WHENEVER YOU BUILD THE SECOND TUNNEL ON THE SAME TURN: 
This triggers on any turn on which you build at least two tunnels. It 
triggers immediately after you build the second tunnel, even if you 
are still in the middle of resolving an effect.
 
z WHENEVER YOU COMPLETE A CONNECTED CITY’S SECOND 
UPGRADED FARM: The city must be connected. It must have 
at least two farms, but it may have more. It must already have 
exactly one upgraded farm. As soon as you upgrade 
a second farm, the effect triggers immediately.
 
z WHENEVER YOU USE THE DEPICTED ACTION SLOT: This 
effect triggers when you choose the slot as your action for 
the turn or when you are using the slot as the result  
of a card effect. The triggered effect modifies the rules  
of the action slot for the duration of your turn.
 
z YOU MAY UPGRADE 1 OR 2 FARMS: For each, pay 1 cred-
it or 1 science. To upgrade 2 farms, you could pay 
2 credits, 2 science, or 1 credit and 1 science.
When you build a city on this site, you must pay  
a surcharge of 3 steelplast and 3 credits. A connected
symbiotic city on this site produces 6 points 
during Production (instead of 2). A nonsymbiotic 
city does not produce points by itself and yields no 
bonus on this site. The production bonus does not 
apply to any buildings or tunnels.
When you build a tunnel on this site, you must pay  
a surcharge of 1 credit. A tunnel on this site produces 
three times during Production if it is adjacent to  
a connected city. This means that a non-upgraded tunnel 
would produce 3 credits and an upgraded tunnel would 
produce 3 credits and 3 points.
This production bonus applies only if you have built both 
tunnels. And, as usual, it applies only if the tunnels are 
adjacent to a connected city. In that case, you gain an extra 
2 credits when the tunnels produce during Production. This 
extra production does not depend on whether the tunnels 
are upgraded.
When you build a tunnel on this site, you must pay  
a surcharge of 1 credit and 1 steelplast. During  
Production, the connected metropolis produces  
an additional 2 points. This bonus does not depend  
on the tunnel‘s production.
When you build a city on this site, you must pay a 
surcharge of 2 science and 2 credits. You immediately
gain 6 points, whether the city is connected 
or not.
Your cards affect your own board during your own turn. Your production cards apply only to your own production. There is nothing that can affect another 
player’s board. None of your cards’ effects apply during another player’s turn.
