Players: 2 - 10
Age: 10+ years
Playing time: approx. 45 minutes
Contents: 104 cards, 1 rules booklet

## IDEA OF THE GAME

The aim of the game is not to get any cards. Each card you have to pick up will cost you a minus point per bullhead shown on it. The player who has the fewest bullheads at the end wins the game.

## PREPARATION

You will need paper and a pencil for scorekeeping. Shuffle the cards and deal **10 cards** to each player. Each player takes his or her cards up in hand and arranges them according to their numbers, **in ascending order.**

### Make four rows

Put the top four cards of the remaining pile face-up in the middle of the table. Each of these cards is the first card in a row, in which there may not be more than 5 cards, including this first one. Put the remaining cards aside; you will not need them until the next round.

## HOW TO PLAY

### I. Playing a card

Each player takes one of the cards from his hand and puts it **face-down** on the table in front of him. Only after all players have played a card are the cards revealed.

**The player whose card shows the lowest number goes first,** adding his card to one of the four rows. The player with the second lowest number on his card is next and so on, until all cards played this round have been added to the rows. Cards are always placed adjacent to each other in a row. The game continues in this manner round by round, until all 10 cards in each player’s hand have been played.

### Which row is a card added to?

Each card can only be added to one particular row, which
is defined by the following rules:

*Rule No. 1:* **“Ascending order”**

The number of the card that is added to a row must be
**higher** than the number of the current last card in that row.

*Rule No. 2:* **“Small difference”**

A card must always be added to the row with the smallest
possible difference between the current last card and the
new one.

**Example:
As shown in Fig. 1, the first cards in rows 1
to 4 have the following numbers: 12, 37, 43
and 58. The four players have played the
following cards: 14, 15, 44 and 61. As the
lowest card, the “14” is added to a row first.
According to Rule No. 1, it can only be put
in the first row, next to the “12”. The same
rule puts the “15” in the first row, too. Rule
No. 1 would allow the “44” to be put in the
first, second or third row. However, Rule
No. 2 – “Smallest difference” – clearly places it in the third row. According to the
same rule, the “61” goes in the fourth row.
Fig. 2 shows the 4 rows after the first round.

### II. Getting cards

Everything is fine as long as you can play your card in one of the four rows. But what happens when a card would go into a row that is full, or when it fits none of the four rows? In both cases, the player who played such a card gets cards from the table, which score against him.

*Rule No. 3:* **“Full row”**

A row with 5 cards in it is full. If Rule No. 2 would put a sixth card in such a row, the player who played that card must take all five cards of the full row. His card then becomes the first in the new row.

*Rule 4:* **“Lowest card”**
If a player plays a card whose number is so low that it does not fit into any row, he must pick up all cards of a row of his choice. His card then becomes the first card of the new row.

**Note:** A player who has to pick up a complete row because the card he wants to play is too low, he will usually choose the row that will score him the fewest minus points.

## END OF THE GAME

The game is over when players have played out all ten cards of their hands. Each player then picks up his bullhead stack and counts his minus points.

Take note of each player’s minus points on a piece of paper, pick up and shuffle all cards and begin a new game.
The game is played over several rounds, until a player has collected **66** or more bullheads. The player who at this point has the fewest bullheads wins the game.
Of course, you can also decide to play to a different score, or for a set number of rounds.

## A FEW TIPS

The following examples should give you an idea of the possible pitfalls of this game.
Example 1: A player puts down the
“45”, thinking he can place it next to
the “41” in the third row. He is mistaken, however, as Rule No. 2 places it
next to the “42” in the fourth row,
where the difference is smaller. That
makes it the sixth card in this row,
the player must pick up the other five
cards.
Fig. 5: Card layout for example 1
BULLHEADS = MINUS POINTS
Between the numbers, each card shows from one to seven
bullheads. When a player has to pick up cards, each bullhead represents one minus point.
All cards with numbers:
containing the figure 5 (5, 15, 25,
etc.) have 2 bullheads each.
that are multiples of ten (10, 20,
30, etc.) have 3 bullheads each.
that are doublets (11, 22, 33, etc.)
have 5 bullheads each.
The “55” both is a doublet and
contains the figure 5, and therefore has 7 bullheads.
BULLHEAD STACK
Put all cards you had to pick up on the table in front of
yourself, face-down, in the so-called “bullhead stack”.
Note: You may not take such cards up in hand for playing.

Variant 2: “Take 6! – Logic”
In this variant, players get to pick their 10 cards themselves. The rules of “Take 6! – Tactics” apply, with one addition: The cards are put on the table face-up before the
game. In turn, each player takes up one card in hand, proceeding clockwise, until all players have 10 cards each.
The four cards now remaining become the first cards of the
four rows.
This variant is especially recommended for players who like
thinking games, and also very suitable for two players (in
the latter case, cards 1 – 24 are used).
Variant 3: “Take 6! – Tournament”
This variant should be played with no more than five players. It uses the rules of both “Take 6! – Tactics” and
“Take 6! – Logic”. Additionally, the following rules apply:
Each player gets a tournament sheet (you can copy p. 16
of this rules booklet for this purpose). On this sheet, he
notes the 10 cards he picked for the first game, and puts
his name under “Name Player 1”. In the lines underneath,
he puts the names of his fellow players, proceeding clockwise (his left-hand neighbour is Player 2).
After the first game, each player takes note of his minus
points, then hands his tournament sheet to his left-hand
neighbour. All players take up the cards listed on the tournament sheet they have just received. When all players
have their 10 cards, the second game begins. After each
9
Example 2: A player has played the
“62”, thinking he was making a good
move. He planned for the card to go
next to the “61” in the first row. It
turns out he was wrong, however,
when someone played the “29” in
the same round, emptying the first row
(according to Rule No. 4, “Lowest
card”). Now the “62” goes in the fourth
row, meaning that the player must
pick up all five cards in that row.

## EIGHT VARIANTS

**All following variants of Take 6! use the basic rules of
the game. Additional rules are described under the
different variants, below.** 

Variant 1: “Take 6! – Tactics”
In this variant, all cards in play are known. From the 104
card total, you sort out a certain number of cards before
the game, which depends on the number of players participating.
The rule is: number of players x 10 plus 4.
Example: 3 players – 34 cards, numbers 1 – 34
4 players – 44 cards numbers 1 – 44
etc.
All cards with higher numbers are removed from the game.

Variant 4: “Take 6! – Professional”
This variant uses the basic rules, with the following additions:
• You can add cards to a row on the left or right, with
the order always ascending to the right and descending
to the left. Whoever has to add the sixth card to a row
– whether left or right – must pick up the five cards,
scoring minus points just as in the basic game.
• A player who could add a card to one row on the left or
to another row on the right must put it wherever the difference is smallest.
Example 1: We are in the middle of a game, with the four rows
currently looking as illustrated on
the right.
The following cards have been
played: 5, 17, 58, 62.
Player A must put his “5” in the
second row, adding it on the left.
Player B must put his “17” in the
first row, on the left, and pick up
the five cards of the row. The “17”
is then put in place of the “40”.
Player C must put his “58” in the
third row, adding it on the left.
Player D must put his “62” in the
second row, adding it on the right.
11
game, minus points are taken note of, and the tournament
sheets passed on. This means that each player will play
with each 10-card hand once, minus points being noted on
the sheets every time.
At the end of the game, each player adds up his minus
points from all the tournament sheets. The player with the
lowest total wins the tournament.
The example shows that the same hand of cards can yield
very different results.

Before the first game At the end of
(four-player game) the tournament

• Take the “1” out of the stack of cards before the game;
it is used as the First Player card and is handed to the
oldest player. Shuffle the cards and deal 10 cards to
each player, just as in the basic game. Take four cards
off the stack as the first cards of the four rows.
• The first player puts down a card face-up. His lefthand neighbour next plays a card, also face-up. When
each player has put down a card, they are added to the
rows according to the rules of the basic game.
• After each round, the First Player card passes to the
left-hand neighbour of the current First Player, so that a
different player goes first each round.
Variant 6: “Take 6! – Nifty”
(for 2 – 7 players)
Each player is dealt 14 cards, and plays two cards per
round, face-down. Once all players have played their two
cards each, they are revealed.
The player who put down the lowest card goes first, adding
both cards to the appropriate rows. However, he may
decide which card to add first. When the first player has
added both his cards to rows, the player who now has the
lowest card in front of him is next, also placing both his
cards in the order of his choice.

The illustration on the right
shows the four rows after the
cards have been added. A player who now played a 1, 2, 3, 4,
or a 63 or 64 would have to pick
up the cards of the second row.
A player who plays a card that
cannot be added to any row must
pick up a row of his choice, as per
the basic rules.
Example 2: If a player were to
play the 59 or 60 in this situation, he could not add his card
to any of the four rows – neither
left, nor right – and would therefore have to pick up a row of his
choice.
“Take 6! – Professional” is a lot
more complex than the basic
game, and players must constantly be on guard to avoid
tricking themselves. This is a variant for those who find the
basic game too simple and not challenging enough.
Variant 5: “Take 6! – Open”
This variant uses the basic rules, with the following changes:
12

1) When twins are played in the same round, they are
added to the same row on top of each other. For the
purpose of counting the number of cards in a row, they
count as one card. However, a player who has to pick
up a row gets minus points for each card.
2) When a card is played whose twin has already been
added to a row and is currently the last card in that row,
it is put on top of its twin. However, if the twin is somewhere in the middle of a row, the card is added to the
end of an appropriate row normally.
3) If two players play the same card, which forces them to
pick up a row, they split the minus points – half points
are rounded up. In order to split the minus points, players may have to use cards from the stack of cards that
haven’t been dealt out.
4) If twins are turned over as first cards of the four rows at
the beginning of a game, they are put on top of each
other and replacement cards are turned over for the
missing rows.
This variant can also be played with the cards of one deck,
plus all doublets (11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99) of a
second deck.
This variant was suggested
by Mr. Uwe Schwarz,
Ratingen.

Variant 7: “Take 6! – Hand”
Each player is dealt 14 cards in hand. The youngest player
begins, playing one or two cards face-up and immediately adding it/them to the appropriate row(s). His left-hand
neighbour is next, also playing 1 – 2 cards and adding them
to rows at once. The game continues in this way, with the
turn to play passing clockwise. A player who must pick up
a row may choose which of these cards to add to his bullhead stack (= minus points) and which to take in hand. He
may take all cards in hand or put them all in his bullhead
stack, but a player may have no more than 16 cards in
hand at any time.
The game ends after the round in which either of the following conditions is fulfilled:
• A player has no cards left in hand at the end of a
round.
• A player has more than 20 cards in his bullhead stack.
All players now count their minus points, with the cards a
player has left in hand counting double! The cards in the
bullhead stack only count as normal (one minus point per
bullhead). The player with the fewest minus points wins.
Variant 8: “Take 6! – Double”
This variant is played with all cards of two card decks (a
total of 208 cards), according to the rules of the basic
game.
For ‘twins’ (cards with the same number), the following
additional rules apply:
