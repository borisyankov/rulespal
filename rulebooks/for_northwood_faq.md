# For Northwood! FAQ

## General

* Unless specified in the ability, you always 'draw' from the deck to your hand, and 'discard' from your hand to the discard pile.
* You are free to look through the discard or score pile at any time, but you may not rearrange their cards.
* If you activate an ability and there is at least one valid way to execute it, you must perform the ability. If there is no valid way to perform the ability, it does nothing.
* When moving multiple cards at the same time (e.g., ‘discard two cards’), you may choose the order to move them.
* If an instruction tells you to draw or move cards from an empty pile (e.g., ‘draw three cards’ when the deck only has two), do as much as possible and skip the rest.
* If it's clear that you've lost a visit (over or under-shot with no recourse) or even that you've already won (hand of 1C, 2C, 3C with non-C trump, correct score) you don't need to finish the fief. Note that this only applies to the regular game, not the scenarios.

## Claws

### Jack of Claws

*If you're holding fewer than eight cards, draw cards until you have eight cards in hand.*

* You can activate this ability if you have eight or more cards in hand, but it does nothing.

### Queen of Claws

*Draw the top card from the deck, the discard pile, and the score pile.*

* Draws you up to three cards, one from each of the discard, score pile, and deck. May draw you less cards if the score pile or discard is empty.
* Drawing from the score pile reduces your score by 1.

### King of Claws

Put the highest-valued card or cards in your hand into the score pile.
TODO

### Prince of Claws

*Draw cards one at a time until you draw a card of the ruler's suit, or you decide to stop.*

* You always draw at least one card.
* If you draw a card of the ruler's suit, the ability ends, but you keep that last card drawn.

### Lady of Claws

*Discard your lowest card (choose if more than one). Draw a number of cards equal to its value.*

TODO

### Baron of Claws

*Choose a card in hand. Search the deck for all cards with that value, draw them, then shuffle the deck.*

* You MUST draw all cards you find in the deck with the same value as the chosen card.
* It is possible to find zero cards if there are none left in the deck. You still shuffle the deck.
* You may look through the discard and/or score pile to figure out how many of a certain card are left in the deck, but make sure not to rearrange the piles.

## Flowers

### Jack of Flowers

*Discard all cards that match the current ruler's suit.*

* Discard the cards which match the current ruler at the time you use the ability. (This interacts with ruler-swapping abilities like JL and PL)

### Queen of Flowers

*Place the top card of the score pile face down on top of the deck.*

* This reduces your score by 1 (provided the score pile isn’t empty).
* The card you just placed on the deck will be the ruler’s statement for the next dialogue.

### King of Flowers

*Discard two cards whose values sum to exactly 9.*

* You must discard exactly two cards, e.g., 1 and 8 or 3 and 6.
* If no pair of cards in your hand fit the criteria, activating this ability does nothing.

### Prince of Flowers

*For each value from 1-8, keep a card in your hand with that value. Discard all duplicates.*

* Cards may be discarded in any order.

TODO

### Lady of Flowers

*Discard a card with value equal to the number of cards in your hand.*

* If you use this ability with no valid targets, it does nothing.

TODO

### Baron of Flowers

*Discard all cards with value 1, 2, or 3.*

* ALL cards with value 1, 2, or 3 are discarded. You do not choose a value then discard all cards of that value.
* Discarding is not optional.
* Does nothing if all cards in your hand are 4 or greater.

## Eyes

### Jack of Eyes

*Draw two cards, then discard two cards.*

* The two cards you discard may be the ones originally in your hand, the ones you drew, or any combination of the two.

### Queen of Eyes

*Look at the top three cards of the deck and return them in the same order.*

* This isn't a memory game - you may take notes as to what the cards are. I even sometimes flip them face up (taking sure to maintain the order), provided I don't do any further deck manipulation.

### King of Eyes

*Name any suit. Draw two cards, then discard all cards of that suit in your hand.*

* You may choose ANY suit, even one that wasn't in your hand at the time you use the ability.
* Discard ALL cards of the chosen suit, regardless of whether they were initially in your hand or part of the two cards you drew.

### Prince of Eyes

*Discard a card, then draw a card. Repeat this sequence for each other exhausted ally.*

* You may discard cards you just drew.
* e.g. You have two exhausted allies as you use this ability. You will perform “discard a card, then draw a card” exactly three times, one after the other. You may not perform the action less than three times.

TODO

### Lady of Eyes

*Draw two cards, then discard any number of cards that sum up to those two cards' total value.*

* If there's no valid combination you can make, you will end up discarding the two cards you just drew.

TODO

### Baron of Eyes

*If your next response is even, draw a card after responding. If odd, discard a card.*

* Timing wise, you discard or draw right after you put your response in the discard or score pile. Whether your response scores or not is irrelevant, only whether it's odd or even.

TODO

* If you use this ability with one card in hand and it's even, the visit does not end immediately. You still draw and play the next dialogue with one card in hand.

## Leaves

### Jack of Leaves

*Exchange the current ruler with a neutral ruler up to two fiefs away.*

* The ability can have as high as four possible targets (2 left and 2 right) or as low as zero targets (if there are no neutral rulers left nearby), in which case the ability does nothing.
* Fiefs don't 'wrap around', so if you're on F#7, you can't affect F#0 and F#1.
* e.g. You’re in F#5, with the other fiefs as per the diagram below. Activating the ability allows you to swap the King of Claws with either the Queen of Claws or the King of Leaves.
jl
* After swapping, continue playing the fief you're in with the new ruler. For example, if you swapped with the KL, you're still on fief #5. The trump suit becomes Leaves for all future dialogues of the visit. If you win, it's the KL that will become friendly (with the KC remaining in fief #3).
jl2
* Your "current ruler" changes after using this ability, which interacts with abilities which care about the current ruler such as JF and QL.

### Queen of Leaves

*Use the current ruler's ability.*

* More specifically, when you activate this card’s ability, treat it as having the text of the current ruler.

### King of Leaves

*Look at the top card of the deck. Exchange it with a card in your hand.*

* The top card of the deck goes to your hand, and a different card in your hand goes face down on top of the deck. The exchange is not optional.
* The card that is now on top of the deck will be the ruler’s statement for this dialogue.

### Prince of Leaves

*Move the 'visiting' card to either the next higher or lower unvisited fief.*

* After activating the ability, continue playing out the visit as if the new fief was the one you originally chose to visit in the first place. Activating this ability changes the target score, the current ruler, and possibly the trump.
* e.g., You’re in F#5, and the other fiefs are as follows. Activating the ability makes you jump to your choice of either F#7 (F#6 is lost) or F#2 (Fiefs 3 and 4 are both friendly)
* If you choose to jump to F#2, the trump is now Flowers for the rest of the visit. The target score is now 2, not 5. The current ruler is now the KF, and he will become friendly if you win this fief.
* Since you moved away from it, F#5 still counts as unvisited. You may choose to visit it again in the future, and it's still a valid target for PL's activation.
* If there’s only one valid direction to move (e.g., all lower fiefs have been won), you must move in that direction.
* Fiefs don't 'wrap around', so you can't jump from F#7 to F#0 by moving right.

### Lady of Leaves

*Draw a card. Un-exhaust another exhausted ally.*

* Un-exhausting another ally is not optional.
* If there are no other exhausted allies when you use her ability, you still draw a card.
* You can't use her ability to un-exhaust herself.

### Baron of Leaves

*You may exchange a card in hand with the top card of the discard pile if it has the same value. Do the same for the score pile.*

* The specificity of the wording makes it sound a bit awkward, but essentially this allows you to color-swap the cards in your hand.
