# Forest Shuffle Appendix

The following provides detailed explanations of the **effects,** **bonuses,** and **point values** of all **cards** in **alphabetic order.** Each entry features, in parenthesis beside the name, where the card is placed in the forest *(tree, left/right, top, bottom)*, its frequency in the deck, and the cost to play the card.

3. Finally, carry out the effects and bonuses of the played cards, in the order they entered play.
4. New cards that you get from the effects and bonuses of the played cards are irrelevant for the Mole: you may not play them via the Mole nor may you use them to pay for the played cards.
5. If you gain any additional turns from the effects and bonuses of the played cards, keep track of how many you gain and take them one after the other, after you complete this turn.

**Special case:** Even if you play the second Mole via the first, carry out the effects of the second Mole when it is its turn in the order of played cards. Cards played via the second Mole will be carried out before any cards played via the first Mole that are yet to be carried out. When carrying out the second Mole, you can play and use cards drawn from effects of the cards played via the first Mole.

## **Violet Carpenter Bee** *(left/right, 4×, cost: 1)*

**Effect:** Whenever the number of trees of a certain species is required, each Violet Carpenter Bee at a tree of that species *increases that number by 1*. There are only five cards for which the Violet Carpenter Bee is relevant at all:

* **Beech:** Beeches do not score points unless you have at least 4 of them. For instance, 3 Beeches and a Violet Carpenter Bee at one of them count as 4 Beeches. Consequently, the 3 Beeches score 5 points each, for a total of 15 points *(see Beech)*. You do not score 5 points for the Violet Carpenter Bee, because it is no Beech.
* **Horse Chestnut:** Horse Chestnuts form a set whose value depends on the total number of Horse Chestnuts in your forest; a Violet Carpenter Bee at a Horse Chestnut increases that value. For instance, 2 Horse Chestnuts and a Violet Carpenter Bee at each of them score 16 points *(because you count 4 Horse Chestnuts)*; without the Violet Carpenter Bees, the set would score only 4 points *(see Horse Chestnut)*.
* **Linden Trees:** Linden Trees score 3  points each *(instead of 1 point each)* if you have the most; Violet Carpenter Bees can help you with that.
***Example:** Anna has 3 Linden Trees, Boris has 2 Linden Trees and Caro 2 Linden Trees with 2 Violet Carpenter Bees at them. Caro counts 4 Linden Trees and has therefore the most. Consequently, Anna scores 3 points for Linden Trees, Boris 2 points, and Caro 2x3=6 points. The Violet Carpenter Bees do not score additional points, because they are no Linden Trees, but they have helped Caro score more points for her Linden Trees.*
* **Great Spotted Woodpecker** and **Moss**: The values of these cards depend on the total number of trees in your forest; your Violet Carpenter Bees increase that number.

In all other cases, consider this **counter example**: You have 3 Oaks and a Violet Carpenter Bee at one of them, and all eight tree species. When it comes to how many Oaks you have, you would count 4 Oaks; regardless, you score only 3×10=30 points for them *(see Oak)*, because the Violet Carpenter Bee is no Oak.

**Points:** The Violet Carpenter Bee scores no points.

## **Wild Boar** *(left/right, 5×, cost: 2)*

**Points:** Each Wild Boar in your forest scores 10 points if your forest contains *at least 1 Squeaker*. If there is no Squeaker in your forest, your Wild Boar score no points.

## **Wild Strawberries** *(bottom, 3×, cost: 0)*

**Points:** Each Wild Strawberries in your forest scores 10 points if your forest contains all *8 tree species*: Beech, Birch, Douglas Fir, Horse Chestnut, Linden Tree, Oak, Silver Fir, and Sycamore. If you are missing at least one tree species in your forest, your Wild Strawberries score no points.

***Example:** You have 2 Wild Strawberries and all 8 tree species; consequently, each Wild Strawberries scores 10 points, for a total of 20 points.*

## **Wolf** *(left/right, 4×, cost: 3)*

**Effect:** Draw a number of cards from the deck equal to the current number of **Deer** cards in your forest. *(Observe the hand size limit of 10 cards.)*

**Bonus:** Take another turn after you complete this one, again choosing between actions A *(Drawing)* and B *(Playing)*.

**Points:** The Wolf scores 5 points for each **Deer** card in your forest. If you have more than one Wolf, these points are multiplied accordingly.
